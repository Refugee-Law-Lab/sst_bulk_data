P.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (491458) dated July 7, 2022 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Peter Mancini\nType of hearing: Videoconference\nHearing date: December 5, 2022\nHearing participants: Appellant Respondent\nDecision date: January 15, 2023\nFile number: GE-22-2672\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is dismissed. The Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant.\n[2] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) has proven that the Claimant was placed on administrative leave without pay (suspended from his job) because of misconduct (in other words, because he did something that caused him to lose his job). This means that the Claimant is disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.Footnote 1\nOverview [3] The Claimant was suspended from his job, without pay. The Claimant\u2019s employer said that he was suspended without pay because he went against the vaccination policy. He didn\u2019t get vaccinated\n[4] Even though the Claimant doesn\u2019t dispute that this happened, he says that going against the employer\u2019s vaccination policy isn\u2019t misconduct. He also argued that because he was entitled to sickness benefits, he should be entitled to regular benefits.\n[5] The Commission accepted the employer\u2019s reason for the dismissal. It decided that the Claimant was suspended without pay because of misconduct. Because of this, the Commission decided that the Claimant is disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\nIssue [6] Was the Claimant suspended from his job without pay because of misconduct?\nAnalysis [7] The law says that you can\u2019t get EI benefits if you lose your job because of misconduct. This applies when the employer has let you go or suspended you.Footnote 2\n[8] To answer the question of whether the Claimant was suspended from his job because of misconduct, I must decide two things. First, I must determine why the Claimant was suspended from his job. Then, I must determine whether the law considers that reason to be misconduct.\nWhy did the Claimant lose his job? [9] I find that the Claimant was suspended from his job because he went against the employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[10] The Claimant and the Commission do not disagree on why the Claimant was suspended from his job. Both agree that he was suspended from his job because he did not get vaccinated.\n[11] I find that the Claimant was suspended without pay because he refused to comply with the employer\u2019s vaccination policy. There is no dispute about this. The Claimant stated he did not want to comply with the policy and said he did not apply for an exemption. He said he knew what the policy contained and the consequences of not following the policy.\nIs the reason for the Claimant\u2019s dismissal misconduct under the law? [12] The reason for the Claimant\u2019s dismissal is misconduct under the law.\n[13] The Employment Insurance Act doesn\u2019t say what misconduct means. But case law (decisions from courts and tribunals) shows us how to determine whether the Claimant\u2019s dismissal is misconduct under the Act. It sets out the legal test for misconduct. It sets out the questions and criteria to consider when examining the issue of misconduct.\n[14] Case law says that to be misconduct, the conduct has to be willful. This means that the conduct was conscious, deliberate, or intentional.Footnote 3 Misconduct also includes conduct that is so reckless that it is almost willful.Footnote 4 The Claimant doesn\u2019t have to have wrongful intent (in other words, he doesn\u2019t have to mean to be doing something wrong) for his behaviour to be misconduct under the lawFootnote 5.\n[15] There is misconduct if the Claimant knew or should have known that his conduct could get in the way of carrying out his duties toward his employer and that there was a real possibility of being let go because of that.Footnote 6\n[16] I can decide issues under the Act only. I can\u2019t make any decisions about whether the Claimant has other options under other laws. And it isn\u2019t for me to decide whether his employer wrongfully let him go or should have made reasonable arrangements for himFootnote 7. I can consider only one thing: whether what the Claimant did or failed to do is misconduct under the Act.\n[17] In a Federal Court of Appeal Case called McNamara, the claimant argued that he should get EI benefits because his employer wrongfully let him go.Footnote 8 He lost his job because of his employer\u2019s drug testing policy. He argued that he should not have been let go, since the drug test wasn\u2019t justified in the circumstances. He said that there were no reasonable grounds to believe he was unable to work safely because he was using drugs. Also, the results of his last drug test should still have been valid.\n[18] In response, the FCA noted that it has always said that, in misconduct cases, the issue is whether the employee\u2019s act or omission is misconduct under the Act, not whether they were wrongfully let go.Footnote 9\n[19] The FCA also said that, when interpreting and applying the Act, the focus is clearly on the employee\u2019s behaviour, not the employers. It pointed out that employees who have been wrongfully let go have other solutions available to them. Those solutions penalize the employer\u2019s behaviour, rather than having taxpayers pay for the employer\u2019s actions through EI benefits.Footnote 10\n[20] In a more recent case called Paradis, the claimant was let go after failing a drug test.Footnote 11 He argued that he was wrongfully let go, since the test results showed that he wasn\u2019t impaired at work. He said that the employer should have accommodated him based on its own policies and provincial human rights legislation. The FCA relied on McNamara and said that the employer\u2019s behaviour wasn\u2019t relevant when deciding misconduct under the Act.Footnote 12\n[21] Similarly, in Mishibinijima, the claimant lost his job because of his alcohol addictionFootnote 13 He argued that his employer had to accommodate him because alcohol addiction is considered a disability. The FCA again said that the focus is on what the employee did or failed to do: it isn\u2019t relevant that the employer didn\u2019t accommodate themFootnote 14.\n[22] These Cases are not about COVID-19 vaccination policies. But what they say is still relevant. My role isn\u2019t to look at the employer\u2019s behaviour or policies and determine whether it was right to let the Claimant go. Instead, I have to focus on what the Claimant did or failed to do and whether that amounts to misconduct under the Act.\n[23] The Commission says that there was misconduct because the Claimant refused to comply with the policy of his employer regarding vaccination. He did so deliberately and knowing that if he did so he would be suspended from his job without pay. The Commission agrees that the Claimant received sickness benefits, but that does not entitle him to regular benefits. The criteria for the two types of benefits are different. His refusal to comply with the policy is misconduct. And that is why he has been denied benefits.\n[24] The Claimant says that there was no misconduct because the employer\u2019s policy violated international codes. He believes the policy violated his rights. He knew he could apply for a religious exemption. He did not apply for an exemption on religious grounds because he knew of others who had applied based on religious grounds and were not given exemptions.\n[25] The employer\u2019s vaccination policy says that all employees had to attest that they were vaccinated by November 14th, 2021. If the employee was not vaccinated by that date, they would be placed on administrative leave without pay unless they had applied for and been granted an exemption from the policy. This policy was communicated to the Claimant on October 6th, 2021. The fact that the Claimant knew the policy is an important part of the test for misconduct.\n[26] The Claimant knew what he had to do under the vaccination policy and what would happen if he didn\u2019t follow it. On October 6th, 2021, the employer told the Claimant about the policy requirements and the consequences of not following them. This is not disputed by the Claimant.\n[27] I find that the Commission has proven that there was misconduct, because both the Claimant and the Commission agree that the Claimant refused to follow the employer\u2019s policy. The evidence is clear that the Claimant had been given the policy, knew the conditions of the policy and knew the consequences of not following the policy. He knew that if he did not have an exemption, he would be placed on administrative leave without pay. Knowing this he refused to follow the policy. The Commission is correct that the criteria for receiving sick benefits under the Act is different from the criteria for receiving regular benefits.\nSo, was the Claimant suspended from his job because of misconduct? [28] Based on my findings above, I find that the Claimant was suspended from his job because of misconduct.\n[29] This is because the Claimant\u2019s actions led to his suspension. He acted deliberately. He knew that refusing to get vaccinated was likely to cause him to be placed on administrative leave without pay.\nConclusion [30] The Commission has proven that the Claimant was suspended from his job without pay because of misconduct. Because of this, the Claimant is disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\n[31] This means that the appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSection 30 of the Employment Insurance Act says that claimants who lose their job because of misconduct are disqualified from receiving benefits.\nFootnote 2\nSee sections 30 and 31 of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee Mishibinijima v Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36.\nFootnote 4\nSee McKay-Eden v Her Majesty the Queen, A-402-96\nFootnote 5\nSee Attorney General of Canada v Secours A-352-94\nFootnote 6\nSee Mishibinijina v Canada (Attorney General) 2007 FCA 36\nFootnote 7\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v McNamara 2007 FCA 107\nFootnote 8\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v McNamara, 2007 FCA 107\nFootnote 9\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v McNamara 2007 FCA at paragraph 22\nFootnote 10\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v McNamara, 2007 FCA 107 at paragraph23\nFootnote 11\nSee Paradis v Canada (Attorney General) 2016 FC 1282\nFootnote 12\nSee Paradis v Canada (Attorney General) 2016 FCA 1282 at paragraph 31\nFootnote 13\nSee Mishibinijima v Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36\nFootnote 14\nSee Mishibinijima v Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36\n",

The Commission upheld its initial decision on reconsideration. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[3] The General Division found that the Claimant hadn\u2019t shown that he wanted to go back to work and had made efforts to find a suitable job. It found that the Claimant had set a personal condition that unduly limited his chances of going back to work while waiting for his employer to call him back. The General Division found that the Claimant wasn\u2019t available for work.\n[4] The Claimant was given permission to appeal. He argues that the General Division made an error of fact and law.\n[5] I have to decide whether the General Division made an error when it found that the Claimant wasn\u2019t available for work.\n[6] I am allowing the Claimant\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [7] Did the General Division make an error when it found that the Claimant wasn\u2019t available for work?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [8] The Federal Court of Appeal has determined that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[9] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and doesn\u2019t exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[10] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner orwithout regard for the material before it, I must dismiss the appeal.\nDid the General Division make an error when it found that the Claimant wasn\u2019t available for work? [11] The General Division found that the Claimant hadn\u2019t shown that he wanted to go back to work and had made efforts to find a suitable job because he wasn\u2019t looking for another job. It found that the Claimant had set a personal condition that unduly limited his chances of going back to work while waiting for his employer to call him back. The General Division found that the Claimant wasn\u2019t available for work.\n[12] The Claimant argues that the General Division didn\u2019t consider the fact that he works part-time and was laid off temporarily. He argues that the General Division didn\u2019t consider the case law of the Federal Court of Appeal indicating that a claimant who was dismissed with a promise to be recalled on a specific date may, for a reasonable period, consider that promise to be the best job opportunity, and therefore act accordingly.\n[13] Taking into account the case law submitted by the Claimant, the Commission agrees that it applies to the facts of this case and that the Claimant should have been given a reasonable period when he was laid off on December 23, 2022, when he knew his return-to-work date, especially since he actually went back to work on that day. As a result, the Commission submits that it is conceding the appeal on the issue and asking that the Appeal Division allow the Claimant\u2019s appeal.\n[14] I find that there is case law that establishes that a claimant can\u2019t just wait to be recalled and must look for work to be entitled to benefits, no matter their chances of success.Footnote 2\n[15] However, in a recent Federal Court of Appeal decision, the Court told us that there is no hard-and-fast rule that a claimant must immediately engage in a job search in all circumstances. There are circumstances in which claimants should be given a reasonable period before starting to look for work to see if they will be recalled.Footnote 3\n[16] In other words, in certain circumstances, the claimant may, for a reasonable period, considerthe promise of being recalled as the most likely way to get a job again and act accordingly.\n[17] The evidence shows that the Claimant was laid off by his employer, for which he has worked for seven years. He is available to work for his employer at any time during his benefit period if the employer asks him to.\n[18] The evidence shows that he was unemployed for reasons beyond his control and that he considered the promise of being recalled as the most likely way to get a job again.\n[19] For these reasons, I am of the view that the General Division made an error of law and made its decision without regard for the material before it.\n[20] I am therefore justified in intervening.\nRemedy [21] Because the file before the General Division is complete, I am able to give the decision that the General Division should have given.\n[22] The evidence shows that the Claimant was ready and available for work from December 26, 2022. He was unemployed for reasons beyond his control. He was willing to work for his employer on request. The promise of being recalled was the most likely way for him to get a job again and he acted accordingly.\n[23] The Claimant should have been given a reasonable period when he was laid off on December 23, 2022, when he knew his return-to-work date.\n[24] The Claimant\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nConclusion [25] The appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nCanada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nCanada (Attorney General) v Comelissen-O'Neil, A-652-93; Faucher v Canada (EIC), A-56-96; Canada (Attorney General) v Cloutier, 2005 FCA 73; Lamirande v Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FCA 311; Canada (Attorney General) v Stolniuk, A-686-93; CUB 76450; CUB 69221; CUB 64656; CUB 52936; CUB 35563.\nFootnote 3\nPage v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169.\n",

The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that she had voluntarily left her job without just cause. It also decided that she wasn\u2019t available for work while taking training full-time. So, the Commission wasn\u2019t able to pay her benefits. The Claimant appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division.\nThe General Division decided that human resources in Ottawa had directed the Claimant to transfer and had started the process with the employer in her favour. The General Division found that the Claimant had never intended to leave her job; she wanted to transfer to another one of the employer\u2019s offices with human resources\u2019 support and guidance. The General Division also found that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the law. The Commission appealed the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division.\nRelying on the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Page v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169, the General Division had found that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act even though she was taking training full-time. But the General Division had decided that the evidence showed, contrary to Page, that the Claimant was willing to work only on weekends and a few hours per week while in school. She spent 42 hours per week on her studies. The Appeal Division found that the General Division had made its decision without regard for the material before it and that it had made an error of law. It could not find that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the law, given the evidence before it.\nThe Appeal Division allowed the appeal on the issue of availability and gave the decision that the General Division should have given. Several Federal Court of Appeal decisions have held that full-time students weren\u2019t entitled to EI benefits when they\nrestricted the type of work they were looking for or limited the hours they were willing to work to weekends or a few hours per week. The Appeal Division found, in this case, that the evidence showed that the Claimant wasn\u2019t actively looking for work and that her availability was unduly limited by her studies. It found that the Claimant hadn\u2019t proven that she was available for work while in school.\nDecision Content\n[TRANSLATION]\nCitation: Canada Employment Insurance Commission v PN, 2024 SST 108\nSocial Security Tribunal of Canada Appeal Division\nDecision\nAppellant: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nRepresentative: Isabelle Thiffault\nRespondent: P. N.\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated September 12, 2023 (GE-23-1486)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 25, 2024\nHearing participants: Appellant\u2019s representative Respondent\nDecision date: February 6, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-898\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Analysis Preliminary remarks Remedy Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed on the issue of availability. The Claimant has not proven that she was available for work while taking training full-time.\nOverview [2] The Respondent (Claimant) applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. The Appellant (Commission) reviewed the Claimant\u2019s file. It decided that she voluntarily left (or chose to quit) her job without just cause. It also decided that the Claimant was not available for work while taking training full-time. So, the Commission was not able to pay her benefits.\n[3] The Claimant argued that she did not leave her job. Her employer\u2019s human resources had assured her she would be transferred from Ottawa to Sudbury. She argued that she was available for work while in school. On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division decided that human resources in Ottawa had directed her to transfer and had started the process with X Sudbury in her favour. It found that the Claimant had never intended to leave her job, but to transfer to another X office with human resources\u2019 direction and encouragement. The General Division also found that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the law.\n[5] The Commission was granted permission to appeal the General Division\u2019s decision. She argues that the General Division did not consider the evidence before it and that it made an error of law.\n[6] I have to decide whether the General Division made its decision without regard for the material before it, and made an error in its interpretation of sections 18(1)(a) and 29(c) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\n[7] I am allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal on the issue of availability.\nIssues [8] Did the General Division make its decision without regard for the material before it, and did it make an error in its interpretation of sections 18(1)(a) and 29(c) of the EI Act?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [9] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[10] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[11] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal.\nPreliminary remarks [12] I listened to the recording of the General Division hearing to decide this appeal.\n[13] It is well established that I have to rely on the evidence that was before the General Division in deciding the Claimant\u2019s application for permission to appeal. A hearing before the Appeal Division is not a new opportunity to present evidence. The powers of the Appeal Division are limited by law.Footnote 2\nDid the General Division base its decision without regard for the material before it and did it make an error in its interpretation of sections 18(1)(a) and 29(c) of the EI Act? Voluntary leaving [14] The Commission argues that the General Division made an error of law because it did not decide whether the Claimant had actually voluntarily left her job.\n[15] It was the Commission\u2019s responsibility to prove before the General Division that the Claimant had voluntarily left her job.\n[16] The Claimant said that she had decided, with her employer, to go to school to enhance her skills. She had been working as an orderly since July 2018 for X Ottawa. Wanting to take training in special education techniques in Sudbury, she asked for a transfer to the Sudbury office.\n[17] The General Division found the Claimant\u2019s testimony credible.\n[18] The General Division found that human resources in Ottawa had in fact directed the Claimant toward a transfer and had initiated the process with X Sudbury in the Claimant\u2019s favour.\n[19] The General Division found that the Claimant never intended to leave her job, but to transfer to another X office with HR\u2019s direction and encouragement.\n[20] The employer argued to the Commission that, because of the different districts, the employee had to leave her job and apply at the new location in the district, like any member of the public.\n[21] Yet the Claimant\u2019s employment contract does not support that claim. It says that the Claimant is hired by the employer X. The Claimant is assigned to the Ottawa branch.Footnote 3 The employment contract lends weight to the Claimant\u2019s version of events that the employer instead directed her toward a transfer and started taking steps to that end with the Sudbury branch.\n[22] The General Division found that it was not unreasonable for the Claimant to accept what human resources in Ottawa said about her being transferred to another office.\n[23] Case law has consistently held that unless there are particular circumstances that are obvious, the issue of credibility must be left to the discretion of the General Division, which is better able to make a decision on it. I can find no reason to intervene on the issue of the Claimant\u2019s credibility, as assessed by the General Division.\n[24] The evidence does not show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant initiated the end of her job. The Commission did not meet its burden of proof.\n[25] Once it was determined that the Claimant did not leave her job voluntarily, it was not necessary for the General Division to determine whether there were reasonable alternatives.\n[26] This ground of appeal is dismissed.\nAvailability [27] The Commission argues that the General Division\u2019s finding, if there is one, is not supported by a concrete analysis of that availability under the factors established by case law and legislation, since the General Division makes no reference to section 18(1)(a) of the EI Act or to existing case law to support its argument that the Claimant was available for work.\n[28] It is true that the General Division\u2019s decision is not an example of clarity. Nevertheless, there is evidence that it did consider the law and the Faucher test.Footnote 4\n[29] The General Division found that the Claimant\u2019s proposed schedules showed her availability and were suitable for an orderly\u2019s schedule. It noted that the Claimant testified at the hearing that she started working on October 18, 2022, for X Sudbury, which, in her view, removed the presumption that she could not work or was not available because she was studying special education techniques full-time.\n[30] The General Division found that the type of work the Claimant did made it possible for her to take her course full-time. It considered that the Claimant had worked irregular hours for four years and had worked a lot of overtime.\n[31] Relying on Page, the General Division found that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the EI Act even though she was taking training full\u2011time.Footnote 5\n[32] But it is clear from the evidence that, unlike Page, the Claimant was willing to work only on weekends and a few hours per week while in school. She spent 42 hours per week on her studies.Footnote 6\n[33] The Claimant testified before the General Division that she had found a job at X that offered her few hours of work but made it possible for her to have some pocket money while in school.Footnote 7\n[34] The Claimant\u2019s testimony before the General Division is consistent with her many prior statements of only looking for part-time or casual work to focus on her studies.Footnote 8\n[35] I am of the view that the General Division made its decision without regard for the material before it and that it made an error of law. It could not find that the Claimant was available for work within the meaning of the law, given the evidence before it.\n[36] This means that I am justified in intervening.\nRemedy [37] Considering that the parties had the opportunity to present their case before the General Division, I will give the decision that it should have given.\n[38] To be considered available for work, a claimant must show that they are capable of and available for work and unable to obtain suitable employment.\n[39] Availability must be determined by analyzing three factors:\n(a) the desire to go back to work as soon as a suitable job is available (b) the expression of that desire through efforts to find a suitable job (c) not setting personal conditions that might unduly limit the chances of going back to work\n[40] Also, availability is determined for each working day in a benefit period for which the claimant can prove that, on that day, they were capable of and available for work and unable to obtain a suitable job.\n[41] To be entitled to benefits, a claimant must establish their availability for work and, to do so, they must actively look for work. A claimant must establish their availability for work for each working day in a benefit period. A mere statement of availability is not enough.Footnote 9\n[42] The evidence shows that the Claimant was willing to work only on weekends and a few hours per week while in school. She spent 42 hours per week on her studies. She repeatedly stated that she was only looking for part-time or casual work to focus on her studies.\n[43] The Claimant testified before the General Division that she found a job at X that offered her few hours of work but made it possible for her to have some pocket money while in school.\n[44] The Claimant\u2019s testimony before the General Division is consistent with her many prior statements where she says she is only looking for part-time or casual work to focus on her studies.\n[45] The Federal Court of Appeal has issued several decisions where full\u2011time students were not entitled to EI benefits when they restricted the type of work they were looking for or limited the hours they were willing to work to weekends or a few hours per week.Footnote 10\n[46] The evidence shows that the Claimant was not actively looking for work and that her availability was unduly limited by her studies.\n[47] For these reasons, I find that the Claimant has not proven that she was available for work while in school pursuant to section 18(1)(a) of the EI Act.\nConclusion [48] The Commission\u2019s appeal is allowed on the issue of availability. The Claimant has not proven that she was available for work while taking training full-time.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nCanada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nSibbald v Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157.\nFootnote 3\nBranch definition: An establishment that reports to a head office.\nFootnote 4\nFaucher v Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 1997 CanLII 4856 (FCA).\nFootnote 5\nSee Page v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FCA 169.\nFootnote 6\nGeneral Division hearing recording: 42:16 to 43:12.\nFootnote 7\nGeneral Division hearing recording: 33:08 to 33:35, and 43:42 to 44:16.\nFootnote 8\nSee GD3-19, GD3-22, and GD3-31.\nFootnote 9\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Cornelissen-O\u2019Neill, A-652-93; Faucher v Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), A-56-96; Canada (Attorney General) v Cloutier, 2005 FCA 73; and Lamirande v Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FCA 311.\nFootnote 10\nSee Page, supra, at para 64.\n",

M.\nRepresentative: T. G.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated August 21, 2023 (GE-22-3826)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: January 4, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-917\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Preliminary matters Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] An extension of time to apply to the Appeal Division is granted. Leave (permission) to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) left her job and applied for EI benefits. The Respondent (Commission) looked at the Claimant\u2019s reasons for leaving. It decided that she voluntarily left (or chose to quit) her job without just cause, so it couldn\u2019t pay her benefits.\n[3] The Commission determined that, instead of leaving when she did, the Claimant could have tried to work out the problems she had with a co-worker. She could have told her employer she was having problems with the co-worker to see if they had other solutions. After an unsuccessful reconsideration, the Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left her job. It found that the Claimant had other reasonable alternatives to leaving her job when she did. It concluded that the Claimant did not have just cause for leaving her employment.\n[5] The Claimant seeks leave to appeal of the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division. Although requested, the Claimant did not provide her grounds of appeal within the period allowed.\n[6] I must decide whether the Claimant has raised some reviewable error of the General Division upon which the appeal might succeed.\n[7] I grant an extension of time to file the application for leave to appeal. I refuse leave to appeal because the Claimant\u2019s appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nPreliminary matters [8] To decide the present application, I must look at the evidence that was presented to the General Division.Footnote 1\nIssues [9] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Was the application to the Appeal Division late? b) If found late: Should I extend the time for filing the application? c) Does the Claimant raise some reviewable error of the General Division upon which the appeal might succeed?\nAnalysis The application was late [10] The application was received on October 5, 2023. The General Division\u2019s decision was communicated by email to the Claimant on August 22, 2023. The application is late.\nI am extending the time for filing the application [11] When deciding whether to grant an extension of time, I have to consider whether the Claimant has a reasonable explanation for why the application is late.Footnote 2\n[12] The Claimant submits that her friend who was working on her appeal had to stop because of work commitment. I note that the Claimant and her friend called the Tribunal to obtain the application for leave to appeal form.\n[13] I find that the delay is only two weeks. The Claimant has given me a reasonable explanation for why her application to the Appeal Division is late.\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [14] The General Division had to determine whether the Claimant had just cause to voluntarily leave her employment. This must be determined at the time she left.\n[15] Whether one had just cause to voluntarily leave an employment depends on whether they had no reasonable alternative to leaving having regard to all the circumstances.\n[16] The General Division found that the Claimant left her job because of a conflict with a co-worker. She did not speak to her supervisor or the plant manager before she quit about her issues with said co-worker. It found that a reasonable solution would have been for the Claimant to discuss her problem with the employer to explore possible solutions.\n[17] It is well established that when a claimant is not satisfied with their working conditions, they must discuss with their employer prior to leaving to give the employer an opportunity to fix the situation. The employer said that if they had known about the problem, they could have tried to fix it.Footnote 3 A claimant also has an obligation to look for work prior to leaving their job. The Claimant did not satisfy any of these requirements to establish just cause for voluntarily leaving her employment.Footnote 4\n[18] Unfortunately, for the Claimant, an appeal to the Appeal Division of the Tribunal is not a new hearing where a party can re-present their evidence and hope for a new, favourable outcome.\n[19] In her application for leave to appeal, the Claimant has not identified any reviewable errors such as jurisdiction or any failure by the General Division to observe a principle of natural justice. She has not identified errors in law nor identified any erroneous findings of fact, which the General Division may have made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, in coming to its decision.\n[20] For the above-mentioned reasons and after reviewing the docket of appeal, the decision of the General Division and considering the arguments of the Claimant in support of her request for leave to appeal, I find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [21] An extension of time to apply to the Appeal Division is granted. Leave (permission) to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSibbald v Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157\nFootnote 2\nIt says this in section 27(2) of the Social Security Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\nFootnote 3\nSee GD3-40.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD3-15: In her application for benefits, the Claimant indicated that she did not look for work prior to leaving her job because she had enough hours to qualify for benefits.\n",

B.\nRepresentative: S. D.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (507007) dated August 12, 2022 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Elyse Rosen\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 31, 2024\nHearing participant: Appellant\u2019s representative\nDecision date: February 1, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-3475\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Matter I have to consider first Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) should have treated the application for benefits for self-employed people that the Appellant made on January 19, 2022, as though it was an application for benefits for employees. This means the Appellant\u2019s benefit period began on January 16, 2022, and not on February 27, 2022.\n[3] The Appellant can\u2019t be regarded to have been working full work weeks from January 16 to March 5, 2022. His involvement in his business during those weeks was minor in extent (as that term is explained, below). So, he can\u2019t be denied Employment Insurance (EI) parental benefits on the basis that he wasn\u2019t unemployed during those weeks.\nOverview [4] The Appellant left his job in August 2021 to start his own contracting business. At the time he left, he had accumulated 2173 insurable hours in that job.\n[5] On January 10, 2022, the Appellant\u2019s wife gave birth prematurely. She had to have surgery and was in the ICU. And she couldn\u2019t look after the baby or their older child.\n[6] The Appellant had to stop working in his business from January 10 to March 5, 2022, in order to look after his family while his wife recovered. He applied for parental benefits.\n[7] The Commission denied the Appellant\u2019s claim. This is because the Appellant had applied for benefits for self-employed people and didn\u2019t meet the conditions to qualify.\n[8] The Appellant filed a second application for parental benefits as an employee, based on the insurable hours he had accumulated in his job.\n[9] The Commission denied the second claim as well. It says the Appellant isn\u2019t unemployed because he\u2019s self employed and is considered to be working full work weeks.\n[10] The Appellant says he didn\u2019t work between January 10 and March 5, 2022. He wasn\u2019t able to work while he was looking after his newborn, his older child, and his wife. He says he was unemployed during that period and should be entitled to parental benefits.\nMatter I have to consider first The appeal was returned to the General Division by the Appeal Division [11] This appeal was originally heard by the Tribunal\u2019s General Division (GD) on February 14, 2023. The GD dismissed the appeal.\n[12] The Appellant appealed the GD\u2019s decision to the Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division (AD). The AD allowed the appeal and returned the matter to the GD.\n[13] The AD explained that it was returning the matter to the GD because the member who initially heard the appeal didn\u2019t look at the right period when she decided that the Appellant was working full work weeks. The member considered the period between January 10 and March 5, 2022. The AD says she should have considered the period starting February 28, 2022. It returned the matter to the GD to allow the Appellant to provide evidence about his involvement with his business for the period starting February 28, 2022.\n[14] Prior to the hearing, I asked the parties to provide additional evidence and additional submissions on matters I felt I needed more information about in order to prepare for the appeal.Footnote 1\n[15] In light of the additional evidence and submissions I received prior to the hearing,Footnote 2 and in light of the testimony before me, I don\u2019t agree that I should only be looking at whether the Appellant was unemployed after February 28, 2022. In my view, to decide the appeal I first have to determine when the Appellant\u2019s benefit period began. Then, I must assess whether the Appellant was unemployed during any of the weeks in his benefit period.\n[16] Since I\u2019m not bound by the directions in the AD\u2019s decision,Footnote 3 I\u2019m entitled to consider more than what the AD said I should consider.Footnote 4 So, I will be looking at the two issues set out below, rather than limiting myself to considering whether the Appellant had weeks of unemployment as of February 28, 2022, as the AD directed.\nIssues [17] At what date did the Appellant\u2019s benefit period commence?\n[18] Was the Appellant unemployed during any of the weeks in his benefit period?\nAnalysis When did the Appellant\u2019s benefit period begin? [19] I find that the Appellant\u2019s benefit period began on January 16, 2022, and not on February 27, 2022, as established by the Commission.\n[20] The law says a benefit period begins on the later of:\nthe Sunday of the week in which the claimant has an interruption in earnings (7 consecutive days with no work and no earnings) the Sunday of the week in which the initial claim for benefits is madeFootnote 5\n[21] The Appellant applied for benefits on January 19, 2022. At the time of his application, he hadn\u2019t worked and hadn\u2019t received any income since January 4, 2022.Footnote 6 This is because his wife had been hospitalized on that date.\n[22] However, the Appellant made an error when he applied. When prompted on the application form to indicate whether he was claiming benefits for employees or benefits for self-employed people, he selected the latter. He did so because as of August 21, 2021, he had been working in his own business. But this was a mistake.\n[23] People who are self-employed generally aren\u2019t eligible to receive EI benefits unless they enter into an agreement with the Commission to receive special benefits and pay the required premia. However, they can qualify for benefits if they have accumulated the required number of hours from insurable employment and can demonstrate that they are unemployed for each week for which benefits are claimed.Footnote 7\n[24] The Appellant hadn\u2019t entered into an agreement with the Commission to receive special benefits. But he had accumulated enough insurable hours in his qualifying period to qualify for benefits for employees.Footnote 8 So, when he made his application for benefits on January 19, 2022, he should have checked the box to claim benefits for employees, rather than the box to claim benefits for self-employed people.\n[25] Because he checked the wrong box, the Commission denied his claim.Footnote 9 But in my view, the Commission should have treated the Appellant\u2019s application as though he had claimed benefits for employees rather than benefits for self-employed people.\n[26] Case law says that a claimant shouldn\u2019t be denied their rights because they checked the wrong box on the application form.Footnote 10 It says if the claimant chose the wrong type of benefits, they should be presumed to have claimed the type of benefits they would be entitled to.\n[27] I asked the Commission to explain why it didn\u2019t treat the Appellant\u2019s application for benefits for self-employed people as though it were an application for benefits for employees, as case law directs that it should.\n[28] It says it considered doing so, but the Appellant failed to respond to \u201cmultiple\u201d attempts to reach him to obtain more information.Footnote 11 It argues that a benefit period can\u2019t be established if a claimant fails to supply information in the form and manner it directs.Footnote 12 So, it didn\u2019t establish a benefit period with respect to the January 19, 2022, application for benefits.\n[29] I don\u2019t accept the Commission\u2019s explanation.\n[30] First, the Commission says that on February 10, 2022, it decided that the Appellant would have to reapply for benefits for employees.Footnote 13 However, there isn\u2019t any evidence that it made a reconsideration decision about the claim where it decided that.Footnote 14 Rather, it told the Appellant it couldn\u2019t reconsider his claim.Footnote 15 And the Commission\u2019s statement that it would have made such a decision is contradicted by its statement that it attempted to contact the Appellant to get more information about the application in order to decide if it could be treated as an application for benefits for employees. Those attempts were made on February 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. This is after February 10, 2022, when it says it decided the Appellant would have to reapply.\n[31] Second, the evidence demonstrates that on March 4, 2022, the Appellant filed a second application for benefits as an employee.Footnote 16 He was instructed to do so by the Commission.Footnote 17\n[32] That application, together with the first application made on January 19, 2022, sets out the Appellant\u2019s employment circumstances and the circumstances pertaining to his interruption of earnings, as required by law.Footnote 18\n[33] Following the filing of the second application, the Commission didn\u2019t attempt to contact the Appellant again to obtain further information. So, I can only conclude that the Appellant had supplied all of the necessary information in the form and manner directed by the Commission, and that the Commission was satisfied that it had everything it required to make a decision about the claim.Footnote 19\n[34] On May 20, 2022, the Commission did in fact make a decision about the Appellant\u2019s claim. It decided that the Appellant didn\u2019t qualify for benefits because he wasn\u2019t unemployed. It also established that the commencement date of his benefit period was February 27, 2022.Footnote 20\n[35] I find that the Commission made an error when it established that the benefit period commencement date was February 27, 2022. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s benefit period should have been established as having begun on January 16, 2022.Footnote 21\n[36] This is because the Appellant filed his initial application on January 19, 2022. That claim was never disposed of.Footnote 22 And the Appellant provided all of the information he was directed to provide that would allow the Commission to treat his initial application (of January 19, 2022) as an application for benefits for employees, as the case law directs it should have.\n[37] Although the Appellant may not have responded to the voicemail message left for him on February 22, 2022, he provided the Commission with additional information about his claim on March 4, 2022, by filing a new application as he was instructed to do. The Commission didn\u2019t ask for anything further before proceeding to its decision about the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to parental benefits as an employee. So, contrary to what the Commission argues, I find that the Appellant met his legal obligations with respect to the supply of information required to establish a benefit period.\n[38] For all of these reasons, the benefit commencement date of the Appellant\u2019s claim for parental benefits must be established as being January 16, 2022, rather than February 27, 2022.\n[39] Because I\u2019ve concluded that the Commission was obliged to treat the January 19, 2022, application as an application for benefits for employees, the issue of antedate doesn\u2019t present itself in this case. However, if an antedate had been required in order for the Appellant\u2019s benefit period to begin earlier, I would have found that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider that issue and that the Appellant had good cause for the delay.\n[40] The AD has said that the Tribunal should take a broad approach to its jurisdiction to manage appeals fairly and efficiently.Footnote 23 It says the Tribunal should look at underlying requests and decisions to determine the scope of a reconsideration decision. I agree with the AD\u2019s viewpoint.\n[41] In this case there were a number of reconsideration requests and a number of decisions. When the entire chronology is considered, I believe that it\u2019s clear that the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision of August 12, 2022, implicitly decided that the Appellant\u2019s March 4, 2022 application for benefits couldn\u2019t be antedated to January 10, 2022.\n[42] I come to this conclusion based on the following reconsideration requests and decisions:\nA decision advising the Appellant that the Commission couldn\u2019t pay him EI benefits for the self-employed.Footnote 24 This decision was followed by a reconsideration request which asks the Commission to consider that the Appellant would be entitled to parental benefits as an employee because he has sufficient insurable hours from a previous job.Footnote 25 The Commission refused to reconsider the decision on the basis that it had not yet decided the issue of the Appellant\u2019s entitlement to parental benefits (presumably as an employee, given that it had already decided he didn\u2019t qualify for benefits as a self-employed person).Footnote 26 A decision dated May 20, 2022, advising the Appellant that the Commission couldn\u2019t pay him benefits as an employee as of February 27, 2022, because he is self-employed and therefore not unemployed.Footnote 27 On June 15, 2022, the Appellant asked the Commission to reconsider that decision for the period of time already taken off.Footnote 28 A reconsideration decision dated August 12, 2022, advising the Appellant that the Commission was maintaining its prior decision.Footnote 29 A decision letter dated August 25, 2022, advising the Appellant that his benefits cannot start on August 21, 2021.Footnote 30\n[43] It\u2019s clear from the evidence that the Appellant always intended to request benefits from January 10, 2022. The Commission conceded this in its oral submissions before the AD.Footnote 31\n[44] It\u2019s also clear that when the Appellant made his June 15, 2022, reconsideration request he was asking the Commission to reconsider his entitlement to parental benefits as an employee between January 10 and March 5, 2022. This is the time already taken off he refers to in the request.\n[45] By deciding to maintain its decision that the Appellant wasn\u2019t entitled to benefits as of February 27, 2022, the Commission implicitly decided that the Appellant\u2019s benefit period couldn\u2019t begin at the earlier date requested (in other words it couldn\u2019t be antedated to January 10, 2022, as requested).\n[46] As a result, I conclude that had it been necessary for me to determine the issue of antedate in order to determine that the Appellant\u2019s benefit period began earlier than February 27, 2022, I would have had the jurisdiction to do so.\n[47] Moreover, had I been required to consider the issue of antedate, I would have found that the Appellant had good cause for the delay between January 10 and March 4, 2022.\n[48] The Appellant filed a claim 9 days after his child was born. After learning his claim for parental benefits as a self-employed person had been denied, he immediately consulted the Commission to determine what he should do.Footnote 32 He filed a reconsideration request on January 25, 2022, as he was instructed to do. After being told, on February 22, 2022, that the Commission refused to reconsider his claim, he filed a new application for benefits on March 4, 2022, as the Commission had instructed him to do. As soon as he learned that that claim had been denied, he asked the Commission to reconsider its decision and to establish the claim as of January 10, 2022.\n[49] In my view, the Appellant acted diligently to have his claim established as of January 10, 2022. I don\u2019t agree with the Commission that he failed to act as a reasonable person would have in the circumstances. To the contrary, he followed up every time a decision was made about his claim by quickly filing a reconsideration request, or by filing a new claim, as he was directed to do by the Commission.Footnote 33 In my view, he acted perfectly reasonably and followed instructions he received from the Commission.\n[50] Moreover, from January 10 to March 5, 2022, the Appellant was dealing with very difficult personal circumstances. His wife had to have a hysterectomy, was in ICU, and needed his care. Because his wife was in no position to look after their children, he had to take on that role. These circumstances are exceptional and are, in and of themselves, justification for the delay.\n[51] As for the fact that there was no reconsideration request of the August 25, 2022, decision on antedate, that is a moot point. There was no reason for the Appellant to ask that that decision be reconsidered. His reconsideration request asking that his parental benefit claim start on January 10, 2022, had already been refused on August 12, 2022. And the August 25, 2022 decision concerned an antedate to August 21, 2021. The Appellant had no desire to antedate his claim to that date.Footnote 34\n[52] For all of these reasons, I would have decided that the Appellant was entitled to have his March 4 application for benefits treated as though it had been made on January 10, 2022.\nWas the Appellant unemployed during any of the weeks of his benefit period? [53] I find that the Appellant must be considered to have been unemployed for all of the weeks between January 16 and March 5, 2022. I find that his involvement in his business during those weeks was minor in extent.\n[54] At the hearing the Appellant\u2019s representative confirmed that the Appellant wasn\u2019t unemployed at any point in his benefit period after March 5, 2022. She says the Appellant is only seeking benefits for the weeks between January 10 to March 5, 2022.\n[55] In light of this confirmation, and having found that the Appellant\u2019s benefit period began on January 16, 2022, I will only be considering whether the Appellant was unemployed during any of the weeks from January 16 to March 5, 2022.\n[56] The law says you can only be paid EI benefits during weeks you are unemployed.Footnote 35\n[57] A person is considered to be unemployed if they don\u2019t work a full working week.Footnote 36 But a person who is self-employed is presumed (in other words, considered) to have worked a full working week unless they can prove that self-employment wasn\u2019t their principal means of livelihood in that week (in other words, the main way they support themselves).Footnote 37 If they can prove this, their self-employment is considered to be minor in extent for that week, and they may be entitled to benefits.\n[58] To determine if a claimant\u2019s self-employment is minor in extent, the law says the following factors must be considered:Footnote 38\n1) the time spent on self-employed work 2) the nature and amount of the capital and resources invested in self-employment 3) the financial success or failure of the claimant\u2019s self-employed work 4) the continuity of the self-employment 5) the nature of the self-employment 6) the claimant's intention and willingness to seek and immediately accept insurable employment\n[59] Case law says that when assessing these factors, I should give the most weight to how much time the Appellant spent on his self-employment and whether he intended to find insurable employment.Footnote 39 But the Commission concedes that given that the Appellant is claiming parental benefits, no weight should be given to his intention to find insurable employment.Footnote 40 It recognizes that a claimant seeking parental benefits shouldn\u2019t be expected to be looking for work. I agree. So, I won\u2019t be considering that factor.\n[60] It\u2019s up to the claimant to rebut (in other words, overcome) the presumption that they are working full working weeks while self-employed. To do this, they must show, on the basis of the above-noted factors, that their self-employment is minor in extent.Footnote 41 This is a factual determination that must be established on a case-by-case basis.\n[61] I will therefore have to consider each of these factors,Footnote 42 to determine if the Appellant can be considered to be unemployed during any of the weeks between January 16, 2022, when his benefit period began, and March 5, 2022, which his representative concedes is the last day he wasn\u2019t working full working weeks.\nTime spent [62] According to the Appellant\u2019s prior testimony at the GD, his written submissions, and the testimony of his representative at the hearing, between January 16 and March 5, 2022, the Appellant spent no time at all working as a contractor. He didn\u2019t attend any job sites during this period. And he spent almost no time on the administration of his business, other than returning a few emails and phone calls and making a few minor purchases.Footnote 43\n[63] The Appellant\u2019s representative testified that the Appellant spent absolutely no time whatsoever on his business during the weeks of January 16 and January 23, 2022, and no more than an hour a week from January 30 to March 5, 2022.Footnote 44 Prior to January 10, 2022, she says he was spending at least 40 hours a week in his business.\n[64] I believe the Appellant and his representative when they say he spent almost no time on his business from January 16 to March 5, 2022. His wife had been in the ICU. She was unable to care for their newborn and their older child while she recovered. So, during those weeks the Appellant had to look after his family. They all needed his care. This took up virtually all of his time until his wife was well again, and was able, as of March 6, 2022, to take over the childcare responsibilities.\nInvestment [65] The Appellant reported on his application for benefits that he had invested $10,000 to $15,000 in his business for the purchase or lease of equipment. But his representative clarified that he made that investment when he started the business. He made no additional investments between January 16 and March 5, 2022, while on parental leave.\nFinancial success [66] The Appellant reported on his application for benefits that his annual income from his business was in excess of $20,000.\n[67] However, he has demonstrated that he had no business income between January 16 and March 5, 2022.\n[68] The absence of income during that period wasn\u2019t merely an issue of the timing of payments from customers, or a slower period in the Appellant\u2019s business cycle. It\u2019s clear from the evidence that the Appellant received no income during that period because he couldn\u2019t accept any jobs. He was unable to work in his business because he was caring for his family.\n[69] So, although the Appellant\u2019s business may have been successful when looked at on an annual basis, it certainly wasn\u2019t successful from January 16 to March 5, 2022.\nContinuity [70] The Appellant doesn\u2019t dispute that he intended to continue his business as soon as his wife was able to resume caring for their children and he could end his parental leave. His representative confirmed that that is what he did as of March 6, 2022, when his wife was finally well enough to care for the children.\nNature of the Appellant\u2019s self-employment work [71] Case law suggests that when a claimant works in the same field as an employee and for his own account, it may indicate that they are using the employed work as a steppingstone for their self-employed work.Footnote 45\n[72] That principle has no application in this case. The Appellant wasn\u2019t working as an employee and in his business at the same time. He left his job to start his business.\n[73] Moreover, the Appellant\u2019s business wasn\u2019t in the same field as his previous job.\nSo, what can be drawn from these factors? [74] In my view, the Appellant has demonstrated that his involvement in his business was minor in extent during the weeks from January 16 to March 5, 2022.\n[75] He spent virtually no time on the business, earned no income from the business, and made no investment in the business during those weeks.\n[76] In my view, this is enough to conclude that he was unemployed during those weeks, particularly given that the case law says that time spent is the factor to be given the most weight here.\n[77] It should be noted that the law recognizes that a self-employed claimant on a parental leave doesn\u2019t have to completely shut down their business in order to be considered unemployed and entitled to benefits.Footnote 46\n[78] So, I find that although the Appellant\u2019s business continued, and although he returned to it after his parental leave, these factors are of no consequence in the particular circumstances of this case.\n[79] In light of the evidence, I\u2019m satisfied that the Appellant has rebutted the presumption that he was working full work weeks from January 16 to March 5, 2022.Footnote 47\nConclusion [80] The Appellant\u2019s benefit period began on January 16, 2022.\n[81] From January 16 to March 5, 2022, the Appellant wasn\u2019t working full work weeks. He has shown that his involvement in his business during that period was minor in extent. This means he must be considered to have been unemployed during those weeks.\n[82] This means the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee RGD2.\nFootnote 2\nIn particular, RGD5.\nFootnote 3\nSee Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., 2016 SCC 29, at paragraph 82, where the Supreme Court of Canada says that administrative decision-makers aren\u2019t bound by the principle of stare decisis with respect to decisions of their own tribunal (in other words they don\u2019t have to follow other decisions of their tribunal), and R\u00e9gie des rentes du Qu\u00e9bec v Canada Bread Company Ltd., [2013] 3 S.C.R. 125, at paragraph 46, where the Supreme Court of Canada confirms that an administrative decision maker is only obliged to follow the directions of a reviewing court when stare decisis applies. See also, Canada Employment Insurance Commission v SA, 2021 SST 406, at paragraph 21, where the Appeal Division of the Tribunal confirms that the General Division isn\u2019t bound by its decisions. Since I\u2019m not bound by the AD\u2019s decisions I\u2019m also not bound by its directions.\nFootnote 4\nI also note that the AD didn\u2019t have the benefit of RGD5 when it set out its directions.\nFootnote 5\nSee section 10(1) of the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nFootnote 6\nSee RGD7-2 and S. D.\u2019s testimony at the hearing.\nFootnote 7\nSee section 7 of the Act.\nFootnote 8\nSee GD3-27.\nFootnote 9\nSee RDG5-33.\nFootnote 10\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Caughlin, A-1168-84 (FCA).\nFootnote 11\nSee RGD5-2. These multiple attempts consist of three phone calls (see RGD5-38). The Commission left one voicemail message asking the Appellant to return the call. The Appellant says he attempted to return calls quickly (see GD2-5). But I certainly can understand, given his wife\u2019s medical situation and the premature birth of their child, that the Appellant may not have been able to get back to the Commission during that three-day period.\nFootnote 12\nSee section 48(2) of the Act.\nFootnote 13\nSee RGD5-1.\nFootnote 14\nThe Appellant had asked it to reconsider its initial decision (see RGD5-34).\nFootnote 15\nSee RGD-37.\nFootnote 16\nSee GD3-3.\nFootnote 17\nSee RGD5-36.\nFootnote 18\nSee section 48(2) of the Act.\nFootnote 19\nAs the law requires it to do (see section 48(3) of the Act).\nFootnote 20\nThis is the Sunday of the week in which he filed his second application for benefits.\nFootnote 21\nThis is the Sunday of the week when he made his initial claim for benefits (see section 10(1)(b) of the Act).\nFootnote 22\nSee RDG5-37. The reason that the Commission gave for refusing to reconsider its decision that the Appellant didn\u2019t qualify for benefits for self-employed people is that it hadn\u2019t yet determined his entitlement to parental benefits (presumably as an employee). This confirms that the January 19, 2022, application was still pending and was never disposed of.\nFootnote 23\nSee MS v Canada Employment Insurance Commission, 2022 SST 933.\nFootnote 24\nSee RGD5-33.\nFootnote 25\nSee RGD5-34.\nFootnote 26\nSee RGD5-37.\nFootnote 27\nSee GD3-29.\nFootnote 28\nSee GD3-30.\nFootnote 29\nSee GD3-34. There is a typographical error in the reconsideration decision. It refers to a decision dated April 21, 2022. There is no such decision. The decision in question is dated May 20, 2022.\nFootnote 30\nSee GD3-35.\nFootnote 31\nSee the recording of the hearing before the AD, at approximately 23:27.\nFootnote 32\nS. D. testified that he attended a Service Canada location in person.\nFootnote 33\nSee RGD5-36.\nFootnote 34\nIn fact, although the Commission decided it couldn\u2019t antedate the Appellant\u2019s claim to August 21, 2021, the Appellant never asked it to do that. The Commission presumed that since he had indicated that the last day worked in his job was August 21, 2021, he wanted his claim to start at that date.\nFootnote 35\nSee section 9 of the Act.\nFootnote 36\nSee section 11(1) of the Act.\nFootnote 37\nSee section 30 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (Regulations).\nFootnote 38\nSee section 30(3) of the Regulations.\nFootnote 39\nSee Charbonneau v Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FCA 61.\nFootnote 40\nSee the recording of the hearing before the AD, at approximately 25:22 and following and 35:10 and following.\nFootnote 41\nSee Hamonic v Canada, 2002 FCA 146, confirming CUB 47481.\nFootnote 42\nExcept the last one, as I explained, above.\nFootnote 43\nS. D. testified that any purchases he made happened when he was out shopping for the family and came across a special on materials he uses regularly in his business. He never went out shopping with the intention of making purchases for his business.

Although that section of the Regulations doesn\u2019t apply in the Appellant\u2019s case, it serves as a useful guidepost for determining whether the Appellant\u2019s involvement in his business was minor in extent.\nFootnote 47\nThe determination of whether a claimant is working full work weeks is made on a week-to-week basis (see section 30 of the Regulations, which says \u201cduring any week\u201d and \u201cduring that week\u201d). Case law stating that a determination as to whether a claimant\u2019s involvement in their business was minor in extent can\u2019t be determined week to week was rendered based on a previous iteration of section 30 of the Regulations and is no longer applicable.\n",

V.\nRepresentative: M. L.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 1, 2023 (GE-23-2095)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 7, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-1076\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) applied to receive Employment Insurance (EI) benefits from April 6, 2020. A benefit period for the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB) was established. On April 13, 2020, the Respondent (Commission) made a $2,000 advance payment to the Claimant.\n[3] On November 13, 2021, the Commission asked the Claimant to repay the $2,000 advance payment. According to the Commission, the Claimant received nine weeks of the EI ERB, while he was unemployed for five weeks. So, he has to repay the $2,000 overpayment.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant received five weeks of the EI ERB at the rate of $500 per week, for a total of $2,500 for the period from March 22, 2020, to April 25, 2020. It found that the Claimant received a total of $4,500. So, he was overpaid $2,000. The General Division found that the Claimant had to repay the $2,000 to the Commission.\n[5] The Claimant seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division decision. He argues that, if the General Division does not have the power to write off the debt, it does not have the power to ask him to repay the overpayment.\n[6] I must decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[7] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [8] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [9] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\nThe General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[10] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that his appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[11] I will grant permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [12] The Claimant argues that, if the General Division does not have the power to write off the debt, it does not have the power to ask him to repay the overpayment.\n[13] The Claimant appealed the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision about the $2,000 advance payment of the EI ERB to the General Division.\n[14] The General Division found that the Claimant received five weeks of the EI ERB at the rate of $500 per week, for a total of $2,500 for the period from March 22, 2020, to April 25, 2020. It found that the Claimant received a total of $4,500. So, he was overpaid $2,000. The General Division found that the Claimant had to repay the $2,000 to the Commission.\n[15] I note that the law in force during the pandemic allows the Commission to reconsider whether a person received an EI ERB payment for which they were not eligible. The law is clear that the person has to repay the EI ERB overpayment.Footnote 1\n[16] So, the General Division made no reviewable error when it found that the law requires the Claimant to repay the EI ERB overpayment.\n[17] The law gives no discretion to the Tribunal to write off the overpayment.\n[18] The law gives the Commission exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether to forgive a debt owed to it under the law.Footnote 2\n[19] For the above reasons, and after reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of his application for permission to appeal, I find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. The Claimant has not raised any issue that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\nConclusion [20] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 44, 52, and 153.6(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 56 of the Employment Insurance Regulations.\n",

K.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 2, 2023 (GP-22-608)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: February 9, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-98\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not proceed. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] Z. K. (Claimant) applied for an Old Age Security (OAS) pension. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) approved a partial OAS pension of 38\/40ths, based on the Claimant residing in Canada from August 27, 1982 until July 1, 2021 (the day before his 65th birthday). The Claimant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to this Tribunal, arguing that the Minister should have approved a partial pension of 39\/40ths.\n[3] The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal, finding that the Claimant was entitled to a partial pension of 38\/40ths.\nIssues [4] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring the Claimant\u2019s evidence about his request to postpone his OAS payments to extend his residency period in Canada to 39 years? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [5] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[6] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[7] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case for an error by ignoring the Claimant\u2019s evidence [8] The Claimant argues that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring his evidence.Footnote 3 The Claimant explains that as soon as he received the May 25, 2021 letter from the Minister stating that he would receive a partial OAS pension of 38\/40ths, he wrote back. He requested reconsideration because he wanted the payment of his OAS pension postponed until he reached the full 39 years of residency in Canada, so that his partial pension would be in the amount of 39\/40ths instead.Footnote 4 The Claimant says the General Division ignored the fact that he made this request.\n[9] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division. In its decision, the General Division acknowledged the Claimant\u2019s argument that his pension shouldn\u2019t have begun until he reached 39 years of residency.Footnote 5\n[10] However, the General Division explained that the Minister calculates the amount of the partial pension based on the number of years the Claimant resided in Canada after turning 18, and before the day the Minister approves the application.Footnote 6 The Minister approved the application based on a residency period that ended on July 1, 2021.\n[11] The General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the fact that the Claimant wanted his pension payments deferred until he reached 39 years of residency. When the Claimant applied, he stated that he wanted the OAS pension to start as soon as he was eligible.Footnote 7 The Minister had already approved his application by the time the Claimant asked for the pension payments to start later. The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division ignored or misunderstood the request he made after the Minister had already approved the pension.\n[12] The General Division set out what the law says about residency periods for the OAS pension, and then applied it to the Claimant\u2019s case. The request the Claimant made after the Minister already approved the application didn\u2019t change the outcome for the Claimant. The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case about any error the General Division made in applying the residency period as its set out in the OAS Act.\n[13] The General Division didn\u2019t ignore the evidence about the Claimant\u2019s reconsideration request. The General Division applied the law to the facts of the Claimant\u2019s application. Once the Minister approves an application for a partial OAS pension, the amount of the pension cannot be increased with additional years of residency in Canada.Footnote 8\nNo new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division [14] The Claimant set out any new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division. So new evidence cannot form the basis for giving him permission to appeal either.\n[15] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand any other relevant evidence.Footnote 9 The General Division explained that the period of residency for the Claimant\u2019s OAS pension starts when he arrived in Canada (August 27, 1982). The period of residency ends the day before his 65th birthday, which is July 1, 2021: \u201cthe period of residency cannot be extended until he reaches 39 years of residency.\u201dFootnote 10\nConclusion [16] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1-3 and 4.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD1-9.\nFootnote 5\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 6\nSee section 3(3) in the Old Age Security Act (OAS Act), and paragraphs 12 and 13 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 7\nSee GD2-13.\nFootnote 8\nSee section 3(5) of the Old Age Security Regulations.\nFootnote 9\nThe Federal Court set the expectation for the Appeal Division to complete this kind of review in a case called Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\nFootnote 10\nSee paragraph 13 in the General Division decision.\n",

P.\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 21, 2023 (GE-23-2402)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 9, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-1120\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Respondent (Claimant) stopped working as a janitorial employee on September 6, 2023, because of a shortage of work. He received Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits until December 24, 2023. After investigating, the Applicant (Commission) determined that the Claimant had worked for another janitorial company on September 26 but had left his job that same day, unhappy with his working conditions.\n[3] The Commission looked at the Claimant\u2019s reasons for leaving and decided that he voluntarily left his job without just cause within the meaning of the law, so it was not able to pay him benefits. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that he had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job after only one day. The General Division decided that the Claimant had just cause under the law for leaving his job.\n[5] The Commission seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division decision. The Commission argues that the General Division made an error of law.\n[6] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Commission has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [7] Does the Commission\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [8] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[9] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Commission to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Commission does not have to prove its case; it must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, it has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[10] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Commission\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Commission\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [11] The Commission argues that the General Division failed to consider whether quitting because of significant changes in his work duties was the Claimant\u2019s only reasonable option. It argues that this failure amounts to an error of law.\n[12] The issue before the General Division was whether the Claimant voluntarily left his job without just cause.Footnote 1 This needs to be determined based on the circumstances that existed when the Claimant quit.\n[13] The undisputed evidence shows that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. The General Division believed the Claimant\u2019s testimony. It found that there was a verbal agreement with the new management that the Claimant would have the same duties as in the previous 10 months, namely general cleaning of the big-box store, floor cleaning, mopping, etc. Contrary to the initial agreement, on his first day of trying out the job, he was asked to wash the dishes and help in the kitchen, on the pretext that they were related duties. The General Division found that there had been a significant change in his work duties.Footnote 2\n[14] I note that the General Division considered whether the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving.\n[15] A claimant has the burden of proving that they had no reasonable alternative to leaving their job considering all the circumstances of their case, not that their only option was to quit.\n[16] The General Division found that the employer was inflexible and insisted that the Claimant perform the new duties. His position was clearly different from what the parties had agreed on. It found that the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job.\n[17] Staying with the employer while looking for another job, as suggested by the Commission, was not a reasonable alternative when the Claimant had been hired to perform duties other than those agreed on by the parties.\n[18] In my view, the General Division correctly stated the legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and looked at whether, after considering all of the circumstances, the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job.\n[19] An appeal to the Appeal Division is not an opportunity for the Commission to present its case again and hope for a different outcome. I find that the Commission has not raised any question of fact, law, or jurisdiction concerning the Claimant\u2019s voluntary leaving that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\n[20] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [21] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nAs per sections 29 and 30 of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 29(c)(ix) of the Employment Insurance Act.\n",

The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) left her job and applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. The Respondent (Commission) looked at the Claimant\u2019s reasons for leaving. It decided that she voluntarily left (or chose to quit) her job without just cause, so it was not able to pay her benefits.\n[3] The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider, but it upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant chose to leave her job after a meeting with her supervisor and the human resources (HR) representative. The Claimant disagreed with the wording of a question on her evaluation, feeling that it violated the Charter of Human Rights (Charter). The General Division found that the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving her job. She could have waited to see if her employer had another solution for her before leaving.\n[5] The Claimant seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division decision. The Claimant argues that the General Division made an error of jurisdiction and an error of law.\n[6] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [7] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [8] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision.

[11] The Claimant argues that the General Division did not consider the combined effect of her reasons for leaving. She also argues that the General Division did not address the question on the employee assessment, which, in her opinion, is contrary to the Charter.\n[12] The issue before the General Division was whether the Claimant voluntarily left her job without just cause within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act.Footnote 1 This needs to be determined based on the circumstances that existed when the Claimant quit.\n[13] The General Division found that the Claimant chose to leave her job because the employee evaluation form prepared by the head of HR had a question about diversity that the Claimant did not want to answer. The general manager held a meeting with the parties to discuss the situation. The Claimant acknowledged that she decided to quit her job after that meeting about the question on the form.Footnote 2\n[14] At that same meeting, the Claimant admitted feeling no animosity toward the HR representative concerning pay equity.Footnote 3\n[15] It is clear from the evidence that the Claimant left her job because of the question on the evaluation form, which she considered inappropriate or unacceptable.\n[16] Even if I were to find that the General Division should have addressed the Charter and that the question on the form was contrary to the Charter, the Claimant had to explore other reasonable options before leaving her job.\n[17] The General Division found that the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving her job. It found that she could have waited for her supervisor\u2019s decision after their meeting on March 8, 2023. The General Division found that the employer was looking for a solution to the problem. It could have excused the Claimant from answering the question at issue.Footnote 4\n[18] The general manager told the Commission that the Claimant could have changed offices or worked from home and that the two employees could have limited their interactions, since they were not doing the same job. The Claimant also could have looked for another, more suitable job.\n[19] The Claimant\u2019s situation was not so unbearable as to support her leaving right away instead of waiting for her employer\u2019s decision. She even gave her employer one week\u2019s notice.\n[20] The General Division found that the Claimant did not have just cause for leaving her job when she did.\n[21] In my view, the General Division correctly stated the legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and looked at whether, after considering all of the circumstances, the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving her job.\n[22] The Claimant clearly disagreed with the question on the form and certainly had a strained relationship with the HR representative. However, the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving her job when she did.\n[23] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [24] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nAs per sections 29 and 30 of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD3-24.\nFootnote 3\nSee GD3-25.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD3-26.\n",

The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) applied for Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits on March 24, 2020. A benefit period for the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB) was established effective March 22, 2020.\n[3] On April 6, 2020, the Respondent (Commission) paid her an advance of $2,000. The Commission also paid him seven weeks of the EI ERB. In total, the Claimant received $5,500 in EI ERB payments. The Commission says that the Claimant was overpaid $2,000 in EI ERB. She should have received only $3,500. The Claimant appealed the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant received benefits for a period equivalent to 11 weeks, when she could receive benefits for a period of 7 weeks. It found that the $2,000 represented an overpayment that the Claimant had to pay back.\n[5] The Claimant seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division\u2019s decision. She argues that she received the EI ERB without her consent. She did not need to take on a $2,000 debt because she had a line of credit. She is asking that the overpayment be written off because she is not responsible for this situation.\n[6] I have to decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[7] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [8] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [9] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[10] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove her case; she must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, she must show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[11] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [12] The Claimant argues that she received the EI ERB without her consent. She did not need to take on that debt because she had a line of credit. She is asking that the overpayment be written off because she is not responsible for this situation.\n[13] On March 24, 2020, the Claimant applied for EI regular benefits. An EI ERB claim was effective March 22, 2020.\n[14] As the General Division noted, the government introduced temporary measures during the pandemic. From March 15 to September 26, 2020, all claims for regular benefits were treated as EI ERB claims.Footnote 1 So, if a claimant applied for regular benefits and their benefit period started during that period, they received the EI ERB.\n[15] During that period, the law did not give the Claimant the option of choosing between an EI ERB claim or a claim for regular benefits.\n[16] Since the Claimant was eligible for the EI ERB, she received an initial advance payment of $2,000 once her claim was established. This payment was made to the Claimant on April 6, 2020.\n[17] The evidence shows that the Claimant received a total of 11 weeks of benefits, when she should have received only 7 weeks. The Commission could not recover $2,000 of the advance payment because the Claimant returned to work around May 10, 2020. This resulted in an overpayment of $2,000.\n[18] I note that the legislation in force during the pandemic allowed the Commission to reconsider whether a claimant received an EI ERB amount that they were not eligible for. The law is clear that the claimant has to pay back the EI ERB overpayment.Footnote 2\n[19] So, the General Division made no reviewable error when it found that the law requires the Claimant to pay back the EI ERB overpayment.\n[20] Unfortunately, the law does not allow for any discrepancies and does not give any discretion to the Tribunal to write off the overpayment. Such a request must be made directly to the Commission, which has sole jurisdiction to write off an overpayment owed to it under the law.Footnote 3\n[21] For the reasons I have mentioned above and after reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of her application for permission to appeal, I find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. The Claimant has not raised any issue that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\nConclusion [22] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 153.5(3)(a), 153.8(5), and 153.1310 of the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee sections 52 and 153.6(1)(a) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 56 of the Employment Insurance Regulations.\n",

The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits on March 10, 2023. She asked the Respondent (Commission) to treat the initial application as though it was made earlier, on August 14, 2022.\n[3] The Commission had decided that the Claimant did not have good cause for the delay because she had not shown that she acted as a reasonable person in her situation would have acted to fulfill her obligations and assert her rights under the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act). Among other things, the Claimant waited until late February 2023 to contact the Commission to find out about her rights and obligations. On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant never tried to contact the Commission between August 14, 2022, and late February 2023. It found that the Claimant chose to put her efforts toward her appeal with the private insurer, her work, and her studies. It found that she had no medical restrictions during the entire period, since she had been back to work since October 17, 2022. The General Division found that the Claimant had not shown that there were exceptional circumstances that would have prevented her from filing her initial application for sickness benefits earlier. It found that she did not have good cause for the delay throughout the entire period of the delay.\n[5] I must decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[6] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [7] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [8] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision.

[11] The Claimant says that her employer directed her to an appeal with her private insurer instead of providing her with a Record of Employment (ROE) to apply for sickness benefits. She worked, studied, and above all, had to rest and do exercises to function normally. She acted quickly to assert her rights with government agencies who did not tell her about the option of applying for sickness benefits.\n[12] The General Division found that the Claimant never tried to contact the Commission between August 14, 2022, and late February 2023. It found that she chose to put her efforts toward her appeal with the private insurer, her work, and her studies. It found that the Claimant had no medical restrictions during the entire period, since she had been back to work since October 17, 2022.\n[13] I find from the evidence that the Claimant\u2019s communications with government agencies were mainly to ask about a possible appeal with the insurer.\n[14] The General Division found that the Claimant had not shown that there were exceptional circumstances that would have prevented her from filing her initial application for sickness benefits earlier. It found that she did not have good cause for the delay throughout the entire period of the delay.\n[15] It is well established that good faith and ignorance of the law are not in themselves good cause for the delay in applying for benefits.Footnote 1\n[16] It is also well established that a claimant who delays applying for benefits because their employer failed to issue a ROE does not have good cause for the delay.Footnote 2\n[17] The General Division found that a reasonable and prudent person in the Claimant\u2019s situation would have contacted the Commission for more information, especially since the Claimant knew the Commission existed, since she had already applied for regular benefits. It found that the Claimant had not proven that she had good cause for the delay in applying for benefits throughout the entire period of the delay.\n[18] I see no reviewable error made by the General Division based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[19] I must repeat that the Appeal Division is not permitted to make a different finding than the General Division on the same facts, given the extent of its jurisdiction and the absence of an error of law, a breach of natural justice, or capricious findings of fact.Footnote 3\n[20] The Claimant referred to an Appeal Division decision in support of her application for permission to appeal.Footnote 4 But that decision does not apply in an antedate case.\n[21] The decision in question concerns a delay in filing an application to appeal to the General Division, which involves another legal test. The Appeal Division found that a Commission agent told the Claimant that she could file her appeal late. For this reason, it gave the Claimant an extension of time to file her application to appeal to the General Division.\n[22] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of her request for permission to appeal, I find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. The Claimant has not raised any issue that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\nConclusion [23] Permission to appeal is refused.

The Appellant was not available for work for a shorter period of time than the Commission says he was.Footnote 1\n[2] The Appellant has not shown he was available for work from April 5, 2021 to October 22, 2021 within the meaning of the law. Because of this, I find the Appellant is disentitled from receiving benefits for that period.\n[3] The Appellant has shown he was available for work from October 23, 2021 to December 22, 2021 within the meaning of the law. Because of this, I find the Appellant isn\u2019t disentitled from receiving benefits for that period. So, the Appellant may be entitled to benefits.\nOverview [4] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided the Appellant was disentitled from receiving EI regular benefits from April 4, 2021 to December 22, 2021 because he wasn\u2019t available for work. A claimant has to be available for work to get EI regular benefits. Availability is an ongoing requirement. This means that a claimant has to be searching for a job.\n[5] I have to decide whether the Appellant has proven he was available for work. The Appellant has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means he has to show it is more likely than not he was available for work.\n[6] The Commission says the Appellant was not available because he was taking training full-time.\n[7] The Appellant disagrees and says he was receiving EI benefits until a.m.stake was made on a bi-weekly claim report and his file was flagged. He said that the first time he was contacted by a Service Canada officer he was told all claims were being pushed through due to COVID. The officer told him all his claim reports were truthful and that he would not have to pay any money back. The Appellant said after this conversation he started getting notices of debt. The Appellant said he was available to work while he was in school. His claim was reactivated when his training stopped, and he was unable to find work. He is now working.\nMatters I considered first The appeal was returned to the General Division [8] The Commission initially notified the Appellant on November 18, 2021 that it could not pay him EI benefits because he was not available for work. The Appellant first appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division in February 2022.\n[9] The General Division member assigned to the appeal wrote the Appellant to find out why his appeal was filed after the deadline to appeal.Footnote 2 The letter did not reach the Appellant because his email address ending in \u201chotmail.ca\u201d had been entered into the Tribunal\u2019s system as ending in \u201chotmail.com.\u201d In the absence of a response from the Appellant, the General Division member, not aware of the error, dismissed his appeal because it was filed late, and no reasonable explanation was given for the delay.\n[10] The Appellant found out his appeal was dismissed several months later. He appealed to the Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division. The Appeal Division found the Appellant was not given a fair process, because, due to the error in recording his email address, he did not know he had to provide information about why his February 2022 appeal was late. The Appeal Division ordered the appeal to be returned to the General Division for a hearing. This decision is a result of that hearing.\nThe hearing was adjourned twice [11] The hearing was originally scheduled to take place on January 4, 2024. At that hearing it was determined the Appellant had not received the Reconsideration File (marked GD3) or the Representations of the Commission to the Tribunal (marked GD4) in time to prepare for the hearing. I adjourned the hearing to January 12, 2024 to give the Appellant an opportunity to review the documents and to prepare for the hearing.\n[12] The hearing on January 12, 2024 had to be rescheduled because the Appellant was not able to get time off work. The hearing was rescheduled to January 18, 2024 and went ahead as scheduled.\nIssue [13] Was the Appellant available for work while taking training?\nAnalysis [14] Two different sections of the law require claimants to show they are available for work.\n[15] First, the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) says the Commission may ask a claimant to prove they are making \u201creasonable and customary efforts\u201d to find a suitable job.Footnote 3 The Employment Insurance Regulations (EI Regulations) give criteria that help explain what \u201creasonable and customary efforts\u201d mean.Footnote 4\n[16] Second, the EI Act says a claimant has to prove they are \u201ccapable of and available for work\u201d but aren\u2019t able to find a suitable job.Footnote 5 Case law (decisions from the courts) gives three things a claimant has to prove to show they are \u201cavailable\u201d in this sense.Footnote 6\n[17] The Commission decided the Appellant was disentitled under both these sections. So, it says he must meet the criteria of both sections to get benefits.\n[18] There are additional rules that apply to decide whether students are available for work.\n[19] Case law, that is decisions of the courts, says that claimants who are in school taking training full-time are presumed to be unavailable for work.Footnote 7 This is called the \u201cpresumption of non-availability.\u201d It means we can suppose students aren\u2019t available for work when the evidence shows they are in school taking training full\u2011time.\n[20] The Appellant can rebut the presumption in a number of ways. He can show he has a history of working full-time while also in school taking training Footnote 8 or, he can show there are exceptional circumstances in his case.Footnote 9\n[21] I will start by deciding whether the presumption applies to the Appellant and, if so, whether he has rebutted it. Then, I will look at whether he was available based on the two sections of the law on availability.\nThe presumption does not apply [22] The presumption that full-time students aren\u2019t available for work does not apply the Appellant. My reasons for this finding follow.\n[23] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government made temporary changes to the law to help people access benefits. This included new temporary rules about the availability of students.Footnote 10 These temporary rules applied to claimants whose benefit periods began during the period from September 27, 2020 to September 25, 2021.Footnote 11\n[24] The temporary rules allowed the Commission to pay a full-time student EI benefits as long as they could show they were available for work.Footnote 12 In other words, the law said the Commission was able to presume that a student was available for work rather than unavailable, provided they could meet the sole requirement to prove their availability for each working day in their benefit period. This means under the temporary rules the presumption of non-availability of full-time students was not a consideration when determining the availability of full-time students.\n[25] The Appellant\u2019s benefit period began on April 4, 2021, which falls in the period when the temporary rules were in place. So, the presumption of non-availability is not a consideration and does not apply to him.\n[26] The temporary rules also allowed the Commission to delay verifying whether a claimant was entitled to benefits. Rather than making that decision when a person applied for EI benefits and before it paid out any EI benefits, the temporary rules said the Commission could wait until after the EI benefits were paid to verify whether a claimant was entitled to EI benefits.Footnote 13 This what the Commission did in the Appellant\u2019s case when it paid him EI benefits from April 4, 2022 to October 9, 2021 and decided on October 22, 2021 that he was not entitled to those EI benefits.\nReasonable and customary efforts to find a job [27] In looking through the evidence in the appeal file, I did not see any requests from the Commission to the Appellant to prove he made reasonable and customary efforts to find a suitable job, or any claims from the Commission that if it did ask the Appellant, her proof was insufficient.\n[28] I note the Commission did not make any submissions on how the Appellant failed to prove to it he was making reasonable and customary efforts. The Commission only summarized section 50(8) of the EI Act and section 9.001 of the EI Regulations.\n[29] Based on the lack of evidence the Commission asked the Appellant to prove his reasonable and customary efforts under section 50(8) of the EI Act, I find the Commission did not disentitle the Appellant under section 50(8) of the EI Act. Therefore, I do not need to consider that part of the law when reaching my decision on this issue.\n[30] I will only consider whether the Appellant was capable and available for work under the section 18 of the EI Act.\nCapable of and available for work [31] As noted above, I only need to consider whether the Appellant was capable of and available for work under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the EI Act.Footnote 14 Case law sets out three factors for me to consider when deciding this. The Appellant has to prove the following three things:Footnote 15\na) He wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available. b) He made efforts to find a suitable job. c) He didn\u2019t set personal conditions that might have unduly limited his chances of going back to work.\n[32] When I consider each of these factors, I have to look at the Appellant\u2019s attitude and conduct.Footnote 16\nWanting to go back to work [33] The Appellant stopped working on April 4, 2021. The Commission wrote to him on October 22, 2021 that he was not entitled to benefits from April 4, 2021. The Appellant testified he began looking for work when he learned that his EI benefits were being stopped and he got a job shortly after he finished his course. This evidence tells me the Appellant did not have a desire to return to work until after he learned his EI benefits were being stopped on October 22, 2021. As a result, the Appellant has not shown that he wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was offered before October 22, 2021.\n[34] The Appellant testified he has worked for the past 6 years. He worked with a relative in seasonal employment and worked for employers when he was in high school and during the summers. He graduated high school in June 2020 and said after high school he worked making masks and then he got a job working nights during the week and on weekends in a grocery store. He usually worked five shifts from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. from Sunday to Saturday. The Appellant testified he has bills to pay and needs the money he gets from working. He began a job search, discussed below, after October 22, 2021. As a result, I think the Appellant has shown from October 23, 2021 onward he wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was offered.\nMaking efforts to find a suitable job [35] The Appellant didn\u2019t make enough effort to find a suitable job from April 4 to October 22, 2021.\n[36] The Appellant did make enough effort to find a suitable job from October 23, 2021 onward.\n[37] There is a list of job search activities to look at when deciding availability under a different section of the law.Footnote 17 This other section does not apply in the Appellant\u2019s appeal. But I am choosing look at that list for guidance to help me decide whether the Appellant made efforts to find a suitable job.Footnote 18\n[38] There are nine job search activities in the list of job search activities: assessing employment opportunities, preparing a resume or cover letter, registering for job search tools or with online job banks or employment agencies, attending job search workshops or job fairs, networking, contacting employers who may be hiring, submitting job applications, attending interviews and undergoing evaluations of competencies.Footnote 19\n[39] The Appellant testified that from the time he stopped working on April 4, 2021 to when he started his course on April 22, 2021 he was busy getting ready for school, purchasing books and attending a two-day orientation. He said he did not look for work during this period.\n[40] The Appellant spoke to a Service Canada officer on October 21, 2021.Footnote 20 He told the officer he was not looking for a full-time job. The Appellant spoke to another Service Canada officer on November 18, 2021.Footnote 21 He told that officer he had not returned to his former employer and he had not applied anywhere else for work.\n[41] The Appellant testified he looked at the Job Bank and the InDeed website for jobs while he was in school. He would get notices of jobs on his phone. The Appellant testified he got a call from Service Canada in late October telling him his EI was cancelled. He said that in October 2021 or November 2021, after his EI ran out, he spoke to his employer at the grocery store to let him know he would be able to work from 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. every day. The Appellant testified he has a resume. In October he gave his resume to some businesses in a nearby community. He also gave out his resume to businesses associated with his trade in his community and nearby communities. His resume said he would be completing his first training block in February 2022. The Appellant testified he spoke to relatives, classmates and friends about places he could look for work. The Appellant was successful getting a job in his trade shortly after he completed his first block.\n[42] The Appellant\u2019s testimony conflicts with what he told the Service Canada officers about his efforts to look for work. When there is a conflict in evidence, I am required to decide which contradictory evidence I prefer. In doing so, I must provide reasons why I prefer that evidence.Footnote 22\n[43] I prefer the evidence of the Appellant given at the hearing about his job search efforts. This is because the Appellant\u2019s evidence was given directly to me under affirmation, and I was able to ask questions to clarify the evidence, which I find to be more reliable than a Service Canada officer\u2019s recounting of what he or she believed the Appellant to have said.\n[44] The appeal file shows the Appellant received a payment of EI benefits on October 13, 2021. He was talking to a Service Canada officer on October 21, 2021. Service Canada sent its initial decision to him in a letter on October 22, 2021. He indicated in his request for reconsideration the decision was verbally communicated to him on October 22, 2021. He did not receive a payment for EI benefits on October 24, 2021 which would have been the next date for a payment to be processed. From this I conclude the Appellant started his job search after October 23, 2021.\n[45] The period under review is from April 4, 2021 to December 22, 2021.\n[46] There is no evidence the Appellant made any effort to look for work before his EI benefits stopped on October 22, 2021. As a result, I find the Appellant does not meet the requirements for this factor from April 4 to October 22, 2021.\n[47] The evidence tells me the Appellant started his job search on October 23, 2021. As part of his job search, the Appellant got in touch with his former employer about returning to work, he handed out his resume to potential employers and talked to relatives, friends, and classmates about where he could find work. As a result, I find the Appellant did make enough efforts from October 25, 2021 onward to satisfy this factor.\nUnduly limiting chances of going back to work [48] The Appellant did not set personal conditions that might have unduly limited his chances of going back to work.\n[49] A recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA), called Page, has said case law, that is decisions of the courts have not established \u201ca bright line rule that full-time students are disentitled to employment insurance benefits if they are required to attend classes full time during weekday hours, Monday to Friday.\u201dFootnote 23 In Page, the FCA also said it is not an error of law to conclude that a claimant is available for work if they are available for employment in accordance with their previous work schedule.Footnote 24\n[50] The Appellant indicated on his application for EI benefits that if he found full-time work, he would accept the job as long as he could delay the start date to allow him to finish his course. He told a Service Canada officer he would not abandon the course if he received a job offer that conflicted with his course schedule.Footnote 25 At the hearing the Appellant said he meant he would take full-time work in the evenings if he could stay in school.\n[51] The Appellant testified his training took place about an hour\u2019s drive from his home and he was in class until 2:00 p.m. He said he would be able to work from 3:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. on weekdays and said he would also be available on weekends. He had worked the night shift from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. on weekdays and Saturday nights before he started his course.\n[52] In my view the Appellant\u2019s attendance at class until 2:00 p.m. Monday to Friday was not a personal condition that unduly limited his availability for work. This is because he would be available for work after 2:00 p.m. and on weekends which is consistent with his work history of working part-time while in high school and also working nights on weekdays and the weekend after he completed high school in June 2020.\n[53] The Appellant testified that he approached his former employer at the grocery store for work once his EI benefits stopped in October. He looked for work through InDeed and the Job Bank. He also looked for work in local businesses related to his trade by handing out resumes. His resume indicated he would be graduating from his first block in February 2022. The Appellant was engaged in an apprenticeship program requiring blocks of study and blocks of work. There is no evidence to suggest that stating when he would be finished his first block of study on his resume meant that he was only able to work after that date. So, I do not think he set a personal condition when setting out his academic qualifications would change with the completion of his first block of study.\n[54] As a result, I find the Appellant has not set any personal conditions on the hours he would and could work that might have unduly limited his chances of returning to the labour market.\nSo, was the Appellant capable of and available for work? [55] The Appellant must meet all three of the Faucher factors to demonstrate his availability.\n[56] Based on my findings on the three factors, the Appellant did not prove that, on a balance of probabilities, he met all of the three of the Faucher factors from April 5 to October 22, 2021.\n[57] Based on my findings on the three factors, I find the Appellant has proven, on a balance of probabilities, he was capable of and available for work but unable to find a suitable job from October 23 to December 22, 2021.\nConclusion [58] The Appellant has not shown he was available for work from April 5, 2021 to October 22, 2021 within the meaning of the law. Because of this, I find the Appellant is disentitled from receiving benefits for that period.\n[59] The Appellant has shown he was available for work from October 23, 2021 to December 22, 2021 within the meaning of the law. Because of this, I find the Appellant isn\u2019t disentitled from receiving benefits for that period. So, the Appellant may be entitled to benefits.\n[60] This means the appeal is allowed in part.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nA person who applies for and receives EI benefits is called a \u201cclaimant.\u201d A person who appeals to the Tribunal is called an \u201cAppellant.\u201d\nFootnote 2\nSection 52 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act says a and appeal of a decision of the Commission must be made within 30 days of the decision being communicated to them.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 50(8), EI Act.

This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) applied for Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits on June 23, 2020. On July 20, 2020, the Respondent (Commission) notified the Claimant that it could not establish a benefit period because he had 0 hours of insurable employment between June 16, 2019, and June 27, 2020.\n[3] On September 28, 2022, the Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider after the 30-day time limit to make this request. He said that the insurable hours were calculated based on the last 12 months when, in his case, they should have been calculated focusing on the earnings he received in 2019. The Claimant says that he was eligible to receive the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).\n[4] On February 3, 2023, the Commission notified the Claimant that it would not reconsider the July 20, 2020, decision. It found that the reasons the Claimant had given to justify the delay in filing his reconsideration request did not meet the requirements of the Reconsideration Request Regulations. The Claimant appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the General Division.\n[5] The General Division found that the Commission used its discretion judicially when it denied the Claimant more time to ask for a reconsideration.\n[6] The Claimant is now asking the Appeal Division for permission to appeal the General Division decision. In support of his permission to appeal, he argues that the General Division made an error of jurisdiction. He argues that he did not apply for regular EI benefits but instead applied for the CERB.\n[7] I must decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[8] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [9] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [10] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue that it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[11] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met on the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that his appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[12] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [13] The Claimant says that the General Division made an error of jurisdiction. He argues that he did not apply for regular EI benefits but instead applied for the CERB. He argues that the Commission made an error in reviewing his file from the start of his claim in 2020. He argues that its refusal was based on an error of judgment and understanding of his application.\n[14] The evidence shows that the Claimant did not have any hours of insurable employment between June 16, 2019, and June 27, 2020. He was laid off by his employer in April 2019 and received EI benefits until June 2020.\n[15] On June 23, 2020, the Claimant filed a claim for regular benefits.Footnote 1 Between March 15, 2020, and October 3, 2020, all claims for benefits were established as the Emergency Response Benefit (ERB).Footnote 2\n[16] On July 21, 2020, he received the Commission\u2019s initial decision denying him benefits because he did not have enough hours to qualify.Footnote 3\n[17] On September 26, 2022, the Claimant filed a request for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s initial decision. He says his delay in filing his application was because he had just understood that he was eligible for the CERB, since he had earned a salary of more than $5,000 in 2019.Footnote 4\n[18] In support of his appeal to the General Division, the Claimant argued that he was eligible for the CERB, and the Commission denied him that right. He says that he did not ask it to reconsider on time because he did not have new information that would help him support his request.Footnote 5\n[19] The Claimant argues that the Commission had the power to grant him the CERB when he applied. He had to ask for a reconsideration within 30 days of receiving the initial decision denying him benefits.\n[20] The initial decision was communicated to the Claimant on July 20, 2020. He filed his reconsideration request on September 28, 2022. His request was more than 790 days late.\n[21] The issue before the General Division was about the Claimant\u2019s failure to ask the Commission to reconsider its decision within the 30-day time limit.\n[22] The General Division had to decide whether the Commission used its discretion judicially when it denied the request to extend the 30-day time limit to ask for a reconsideration of the initial decision.Footnote 6 After reviewing the Claimant\u2019s evidence, the General Division found that the Commission had properly used its discretion.\n[23] The General Division found that the Claimant had not given a reasonable explanation for the delay of more than 790 days in asking for a reconsideration. It found that the Claimant did not have a continuing intention to pursue his appeal because he did not take any action until after he learned he was eligible to receive the CERB. He even delayed until September 28, 2022, to apply after learning that he was eligible for the CERB.\n[24] The General Division found that the Commission considered all the factors relevant to the Claimant\u2019s situation. Before making its decision, it considered that the Claimant was caring for his ill partner, and it also considered the Claimant\u2019s arguments about the CERB. The General Division found that the Commission used its discretion judicially when it refused to give more time to ask for a reconsideration of the initial decision.\n[25] From reading the application for permission to appeal, I understand very well that the Claimant is criticizing the Commission for failing to inform him of his eligibility for the CERB as soon as his application was filed, and that this deprived him of the CERB. But the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to order compensation for damages suffered as a result of an alleged breach by the Commission. This is a debate for another forum.Footnote 7\n[26] In support of his application for permission to appeal, the Claimant has not identified any errors of jurisdiction or failure by the General Division to observe a principle of natural justice. He has not identified errors of law or any erroneous findings of fact that the General Division may have made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it in coming to its decision.\n[27] For the above reasons, and after reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of his application for permission to appeal, I must find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [28] Permission to appeal is refused. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee GD3-3 to GD3-10.\nFootnote 2\nSee sections 152.03 and 153.8(5) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\nFootnote 3\nSee GD3-11.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD3-13, GD3-14, and GD3-15.\nFootnote 5\nSee GD2-1.\nFootnote 6\nSee section 112(1)(b) of the EI Act; and section 1 of the Reconsideration Request Regulations.\nFootnote 7\nSee T.

D.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nRepresentative: Andrew Kirk\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated June 29, 2023 (GP-23-61)\nTribunal member: Neil Nawaz\nType of hearing: In Writing\nDecision date: February 14, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-886\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] I am dismissing this appeal. The Appellant is not entitled to a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension.\nOverview [2] The Appellant is a 62-year-old former bricklayer with a history of hypertension and diabetes. In the late 1990s, he broke his right leg, which impaired his mobility. He hasn\u2019t had a full-time job since 2011 and has worked only intermittently since then.\n[3] The Appellant applied for a CPP disability pension on November 29, 2012.Footnote 1 The Minister refused the application after finding that the Appellant was not disabled during his minimum qualifying period (MQP), which ended on December 31, 2013. On May 19, 2016, this Tribunal\u2019s General Division upheld the Minister\u2019s refusal, and on August 29, 2017, the Appeal Division denied leave to appeal.\n[4] The Appellant re-applied for a CPP disability pension on January 28, 2022. The Minister again refused the application, and the General Division again dismissed his appeal. The General Division found that, because of a legal principle known as res judicata, it was barred from deciding a matter that it had already decided. The General Division also found that the Appellant was not entitled to the post-retirement disability benefit (PRDB).\n[5] The Appellant then applied for permission to appeal to the Appeal Division. Last year, one of my colleagues on the Appeal Division granted the Appellant permission to appeal. At the Appellant\u2019s request, I decided this matter based on a review of the written record.\nIssues [6] In this appeal, I had to answer three questions:\nDoes res judicata prevent me from considering the Appellant\u2019s CPP disability claim? If res judicata doesn\u2019t apply, did the Appellant have a severe and prolonged disability as of December 31, 2013? Is the Appellant entitled to the PRDB?\nAnalysis [7] Having considered submissions from both parties, I have concluded that I can\u2019t consider the Appellant\u2019s claim for a CPP disability pension.\nRes judicata prevents this matter from being heard again [8] A well-established legal principle called res judicata prevents courts and tribunals from considering cases that have already been decided. The Federal Court has stated that res judicata specifically applies to decisions of the Social Security Tribunal.Footnote 2\n[9] In a case called Danyluk, the Supreme Court of Canada held that there are sound public policy reasons for res judicata:\nAn issue, once decided, should not generally be re-litigated to the benefit of the losing party and the harassment of the winner. A person should only be vexed once in the same cause. Duplicative litigation, potential inconsistent results, undue costs, and inconclusive proceedings are to be avoided.Footnote 3\n[10] There are exceptions to the principle, but the Appellant does not fall under any of them.\nMatters can\u2019t be heard again unless they substantially differ from what came before [11] Danlyluk set out a two-step analysis for applying res judicata.Footnote 4 First, the following conditions must be met:\nThe prior proceeding involved the same parties as the current one; It addressed the same issues; and It led to a final decision.\n[12] Second, even if these three conditions are met, Danyluk permits decision-makers somediscretion in whether to apply res judicata. However, that discretion must be exercised by keeping in mind factors such as\nthe circumstances that led to the prior proceeding; the wording of the statute; the purpose of the legislation; the availability of appeal; the safeguards available to the parties at the administrative level; the expertise of the decision-maker at the administrative level; and the potential for injustice.\n[13] Applying the Danyluk analysis, I find that the Appellant\u2019s ability to work before December 31, 2013 has already been adjudicated. I am unwilling to use my discretion to hear this matter again.\nThe Appellant\u2019s current appeal involves issues that the General Division addressed in its May 2016 decision [14] On May 17, 2016, the General Division decided that the Appellant did not have a severe and prolonged disability as of December 31, 2013.\n[15] I can\u2019t revisit that decision, because res judicata bars me from considering matters that the General Division has already decided. In this case, the General Division\u2019s May 2016 decision\ninvolved the same parties \u2013 the Appellant and the Minister; addressed the same issues \u2013 whether the Appellant had a severe and prolonged disability by December 31, 2013; and was final \u2013 the Appellant never sought judicial review.\n[16] As well, the medical evidence about the Appellant\u2019s medical condition and work history before December 31, 2013 is essentially the same in all of his applications.\n[17] All three of the conditions in Danyluk\u2019s first step have met. As for the factors in the second step, I see no reason not to apply res judicata. The General Division held a hearing by teleconference, and the Appellant attended it and gave evidence. The member who heard his case explained the issues thoroughly, and I am satisfied that the Appellant knew the case he had to make. I can\u2019t say he was deprived of an opportunity to have his CPP disability claim fairly assessed and adjudicated. I see no injustice on the face of the General Division\u2019s decision.\nI can\u2019t consider whether the Appellant had a severe and prolonged disability as of December 31, 2013 [18] CPP disability claimants usually have to show that their disability was severe and prolonged during their coverage period. However, I am barred from considering that question here because, as noted, the General Division already decided it nearly eight years ago.\nThe Appellant is not entitled to the PRDB [19] The PRDB is a relatively new benefit that is designed to provide disability protection for CPP contributors who have not reached age 65. In order to receive the PRDB, applicants must establish an MQP by showing specific contributions to the CPP.Footnote 5\n[20] In this case, since the Appellant had more than 25 years of earnings in total, he had to show that he made CPP contributions in three of the six calendar years immediately before his application date.Footnote 6 The Appellant applied for disability benefits on January 28, 2022, but he did not register contributions in any of the years from 2016 to 2021 inclusively.Footnote 7 As a result, he does not have an MQP for the purpose of the PRDB.\nConclusion [21] The Appellant\u2019s claim for the CPP disability pension is res judicata. Because this matter has already been decided, I can\u2019t consider whether he had a severe and prolonged disability as of December 31, 2013.\n[22] The Appellant has no coverage for the PRDB because he has no CPP contributions in the six calendar years preceding his application.\n[23] The appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nThe Appellant had previously applied for a CPP disability pension on January 11, 2011. The Minister refused that application initially and on reconsideration. The Appellant did not appeal those refusals.\nFootnote 2\nSee Belo-Alves v Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FC 1100.\nFootnote 3\nSee Danyluk v Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44.\nFootnote 4\nSee Danyluk, paragraph 18.\nFootnote 5\nSee Canada Pension Plan, sections 44(1)(h), 44(4), and 70.01\nFootnote 6\nIn a case called N.L. v Minister of Employment and Social Development, 2020 SST 741, the Appeal Division explained how to determine an MQP for PRDB purposes.\nFootnote 7\nSee the Appellant\u2019s updated record of earnings, GD5-24.\n",

The appeal will not proceed. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] S. M. (Claimant) started receiving a CPP retirement pension in June 2021. He applied for a CPP disability pension on September 23, 2022. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused his CPP disability pension application because he applied more than 15 months after he started receiving a CPP retirement pension.Footnote 1\n[3] The Claimant also didn\u2019t qualify for the post-retirement disability benefit (PRDB) because his qualifying period ended before January 2019 when the benefit came into effect. The rules about coverage periods for the PRDB changed in May 2023, but the Claimant still wasn\u2019t eligible.\n[4] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed his appeal, finding that the Claimant wasn\u2019t eligible for either:\ncancelling his CPP retirement pension in favor of a disability pension; or qualifying for the PRDB.\nIssues [5] The issues in this appeal are as follows:\na) Can it be argued that the General Division failed to provide the Claimant with a fair process? b) Can it be argued that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring the evidence about the reasons why the Claimant applied for the disability pension more than 15 months after he started receiving the CPP retirement pension? c) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [6] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 2\n[7] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 3\n[8] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division failed to provide the Claimant with a fair process [9] The Claimant argues that the decision from the General Division was unfair.Footnote 4\n[10] In my view, the issues he raises are about the fairness of the result when the requirements for the CPP disability pension and the PRDB are applied to his situation. He points to a series of barriers in accessing the CPP disability pension when the criteria for that pension is based on coverage periods (and those coverage periods are based on contributions to the plan).\n[11] I can grant permission to appeal if the Claimant raises an arguable case that the General Division has failed to provide him with a fair process, but the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made this kind of error. The fairness issue the Claimant raises isn\u2019t about the process.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring the reasons why the Claimant didn\u2019t apply for the disability pension sooner [12] The Claimant argues that he experienced real barriers to applying any sooner for the disability pension. He explains that he applied quickly once his diagnosis became clear and he realized that he wouldn\u2019t be able to work because of disability.\n[13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error of fact by the General Division. The General Division decision mentions the reasons why the Claimant took longer to apply for the disability pension. The General Division noted his concern about the Minister asking him for medical information despite knowing he didn\u2019t qualify based on the timing of the application.Footnote 5\n[14] There\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division ignored or misunderstood the reasons the Claimant gave for applying more than 15 months after he started receiving the retirement pension. The General Division mentioned these reasons but explained that the law still applied to the Claimant: he applied too late to cancel his retirement pension in favour of the disability pension. The General Division confirmed that the Claimant started receiving his retirement pension on June 1, 2021. He applied for the disability pension on September 23, 2022. He applied more than 15 months after he started receiving the retirement pension.Footnote 6\n[15] The Claimant isn\u2019t arguing that he applied earlier than September 23, 2022. The General Division found that the Claimant applied too late, and the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that there is any error in the reasoning or the conclusion. I can see no possible error in the General Division\u2019s decision about the fact that the Claimant applied too late for the disability pension.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out new evidence [16] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division, so new evidence cannot form the basis for a decision to give the Claimant permission to appeal.\n[17] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence about when the Claimant applied for the disability pension, or about his coverage period for the PRDB.Footnote 7\n[18] Although the Claimant didn\u2019t argue that the General Division made any specific error about his eligibility for the PRDB, I\u2019m satisfied that there\u2019s no arguable case for an error in that part of the General Division\u2019s decision. The General Division considered both the Claimant\u2019s contributions when he applied for the CPP disability pension in 2022, and when he was receiving a CPP retirement pension in 2021. The General Division explained that he didn\u2019t have enough contributions to qualify either in 2021 or 2022.Footnote 8\nConclusion [19] I\u2019ve refused permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee paragraphs 14 to 16 in the General Division decision, which explain how sections 42(2)(b), 44(b), and 66.1 of the CPP apply together to allow claimants to cancel a retirement pension in favour of a disability pension, but only when the claimant is deemed disabled before the month the retirement pension became payable, and no one can be deemed disabled more than 15 months before the application date.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 3\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 4\nSee AD1-5.\nFootnote 5\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 6\nSee section 66.1(1.1) of the CPP, and section 46.2(1) of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations.\nFootnote 7\nThe Federal Court set the expectation for this type of review by the Appeal Division in a case called Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\nFootnote 8\nSee paragraphs 23 to 28 in the General Division decision.\n",

C.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated December 11, 2023 (GE-23-2182)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 15, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-11\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue I am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is not granted. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) stopped working for his employer. He made an initial claim for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. A benefit period was established effective February 5, 2023.\n[3] On April 26, 2023, the Respondent (Commission) told the Claimant that he was not entitled to EI benefits from January 29, 2023, because he voluntarily left his employment with the employer without just cause as defined in the law. The Claimant said that he had no choice but to stop working for the employer. Mechanical problems with his car prevented him from going to work, and there was no point in getting it fixed, given how old it was. On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that when he started working for the employer in November 2021, he knew that he needed a vehicle to get to his workplace, which was about 30 kilometres from his home. He knew his conditions of employment and accepted them. The General Division found that before leaving his job, the Claimant could have talked to his employer to try to find a solution to his transportation problem. The General Division decided that the Claimant did not have just cause under the law for leaving his job.\nIssue [5] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[6] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case; he must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[7] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [8] The Claimant argues that the General Division failed to consider his circumstances. He had no way of travelling the more than 30 kilometres between his home and work anymore. The area where he worked is inaccessible by public transit. He argues that the situation calls for some compassion and going beyond the wording of the law.\n[9] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that when he started working for the employer in November 2021, he knew that he needed a vehicle to get to his workplace, which was about 30 kilometres from his home. He knew his conditions of employment and accepted them. The General Division found that before leaving his job, the Claimant could have talked to his employer to try to find a solution to his transportation problem. The General Division decided that the Claimant did not have just cause under the law for leaving his job.\n[10] The Claimant decided to leave his job because mechanical problems with his car made getting to work difficult, if not impossible at the time, which is not in itself a reason that the law accepts. As the General Division noted, the Claimant did not try to talk to his employer to address the problem. Having failed to meet a strict obligation imposed on him by law, he is disentitled from receiving EI benefits.\n[11] In my view, the General Division correctly stated the legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and looked at whether, after considering all of the circumstances, the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job.\n[12] An appeal to the Appeal Division is not an opportunity for the Claimant to present his case again and hope for a different outcome. I find that the Claimant has not raised any question of fact, law, or jurisdiction that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\n[13] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [14] Permission to appeal is not granted. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\n",

(Claimant) stopped working as a general cafeteria helper and applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension. She started receiving the pension in January 2006. In 2013, she started working part time. She continued working every year after that until she was laid off during the pandemic.\n[3] The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) wrote to the Claimant in July 2020 and explained that they were reviewing her file. The Minister gathered information about the Claimant\u2019s earnings. In August 2021, the Minister explained that the Claimant wasn\u2019t eligible for any of the disability pension payments she received after April 2018.\n[4] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed the appeal, finding that the Minister proved that the Claimant stopped being disabled within the meaning of the CPP in April 2018.\n[5] The Claimant made an application to the Appeal Division stating that she disagreed with the outcome at the General Division.Footnote 1 The Claimant said she has a disability, and her disability pension should not have stopped.\nIssue [6] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Could the General Division have made an error that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [7] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 2\n[8] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 3\n[9] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence that would justify giving her permission to appeal, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error [10] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised any argument about a possible error by the General Division that has a reasonable chance of success. She argues that she cannot earn much income because of her disability. She does not think that her disability pension should have stopped.Footnote 4\n[11] The General Division had to decide whether the Claimant stopped having a severe disability within the meaning of the CPP in 2018. The disability pension stops being payable when the Claimant stops having a severe and prolonged disability within the meaning of the CPP.Footnote 5 The Minister is responsible for proving that its more likely than not that the Claimant stopped being disabled when they stopped the payments in April 2018.Footnote 6\n[12] The General Division found the following:Footnote 7\nThe Claimant worked from October 2015 to December 2018 as a general kitchen helper. She stopped working because of a shortage of work. Her earnings in 2013, 2014, and 2015 were under $6,000.00. In 2016, her earnings were $12,159.00. Her earnings in 2017 were $11,868.00. The Claimant worked from December 2018 to April 2020 as a general helper in a different kitchen until she was laid off during the pandemic. She worked 37.5 hours per week and earned $15.25 an hour. In 2018, the Claimant earned $16,542.00. In 2019, she earned $29,842.00. In 2018, CPP regulations stated that substantially gainful earnings were $16,029.96. In 2019, they were $16,347.60. Accordingly, the Claimant made more than substantially gainful earnings in both years. The Claimant worked continuously, and her attendance was good. She received some accommodation at work: she was allowed to sit when needed and she wasn\u2019t required to do a lot of walking. But the expectations at work weren\u2019t lowered in a way that meant the work was benevolent. The Claimant\u2019s age, education, ability to communicate in English, and experience in the food service sector means that she was employable in the real world in 2018.\n[13] The Minister satisfied the General Division that by April 2018, the Claimant was no longer incapable regularly of pursing any substantially gainful occupation. She was continuously working full-time as a kitchen helper and making more than a substantially gainful income in 2018 and 2019.\n[14] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised any error the General Division might have made in its decision about the work she did starting in 2018 and what that work tells us about her regular ability to make a living despite her medical conditions.\n[15] I cannot give the Claimant permission to appeal. The nature of the Claimant\u2019s medical conditions and the limitations she has in terms of her ability to work today are not relevant to the question the General Division had to decide.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division [16] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division. Accordingly, new evidence cannot form the basis for permission to appeal either.\n[17] I\u2019ve reviewed the record.Footnote 8 I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division hasn\u2019t ignored or misunderstood the evidence in the record about the nature of the Claimant\u2019s work and what it tells us about her disability no longer being severe within the meaning of the CPP. The evidence showed that she earned substantially gainful income in 2018 and 2019. I don\u2019t see any evidence that the General Division may have missed or misunderstood in terms of the income she earned, the work she completed, or how reliable she was. I also see no evidence that the General Division may have missed about whether the Claimant\u2019s employer was benevolent.\nConclusion [18] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nThe Appeal Division gave the Claimant an additional chance to provide more information to the Appeal Division if she chose to do so.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 3\nSee section 58.1(c) in the Act.\nFootnote 4\nSee AD1-1.\nFootnote 5\nSee sections 70(1)(a) and 42(2) in the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).\nFootnote 6\nSee Atkinson v Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 187.\nFootnote 7\nSee paragraphs 29 to 48 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 8\nThe Federal Court\u2019s says the Appeal Division should complete this kind of review in a case called Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

T.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated December 1, 2023 (GE-23-2159)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 16, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-24\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) worked at X and left on December 12, 2020. On January 20, 2021, he told the Respondent (Commission) that he had left that job for another job at X that was supposed to start on January 19, 2021. Then, on October 14, 2021, the Claimant told the Commission that he had left his job on December 12, 2020, to go work for X and X. He said this job started on January 5, 2021.\n[3] On October 19, 2021, the Commission decided that the Claimant voluntarily left his job without just cause. It disqualified the Claimant from receiving benefits from December 6, 2020. This created an overpayment.\n[4] The Claimant asked for a reconsideration on March 17, 2022. He argued that he already had a job with X and X when he left his job with X. On April 22, 2022, the Commission upheld its initial decision about voluntary leaving.\n[5] The Claimant filed a second reconsideration request on June 9, 2023. In its July 13, 2023, decision, the Commission said that it would not reconsider its decision because more than 30 days had passed since the April 22, 2022, decision and there was no explanation for the delay. On August 6, 2023, the Claimant appealed the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division.\n[6] The General Division found that it had no choice but to apply the law, which says that the General Division may allow up to one year to appeal after the April 22, 2022, reconsideration decision was communicated.Footnote 1 The appeal was not heard.\n[7] The Claimant now seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division decision. He argues that the General Division did not consider that he left his job at X because he already had assurance of another job at X.\n[8] I have to decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[9] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [10] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [11] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\nThe General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[12] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case; he must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he must show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[13] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [14] The Claimant says that the General Division did not consider that he left his job at X because he already had assurance of another job at X before leaving.\n[15] In support of his appeal to the General Division, the Claimant filed his earnings as evidence to show that he had left X for another job in January 2021.\n[16] The issue before the General Division involved an indefinite disqualification that was imposed on the Claimant under sections 29 and 30 of the Employment Insurance Act because he voluntarily left his job without just cause.\n[17] The decision in this case was made on reconsideration by the Commission on April 22, 2022. The reconsideration decision states that the Claimant has 30 days after receiving the decision to appeal to the Tribunal.\n[18] At the hearing, the Claimant confirmed that he had received the reconsideration decision in question. He did not challenge this decision before the Tribunal because he felt he was not ready. He needed to talk to people and gather his evidence.\n[19] The General Division found that the Claimant had received the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision on or around May 2, 2022. It found that the Claimant did not appeal the reconsideration decision to the General Division until August 6, 2023.\n[20] The General Division found that it had no choice but to apply the law, which says that the General Division may allow up to one year to appeal after the reconsideration decision is communicated.Footnote 2 The appeal was not heard.\n[21] The evidence shows that the Claimant received the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision in May 2022. He did not file his notice of appeal until August 6, 2023, which was 14 months later.\n[22] This means that more than one year passed between the time the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision was communicated to the Claimant and the time the Claimant duly appealed it to the General Division.\n[23] I sympathize with the Claimant. But the law clearly states that the General Division cannot extend the time to appeal beyond one year. Given his delay of more than a year in filing his appeal, the General Division could not hear his challenge about voluntarily leaving.\n[24] Unfortunately, the law does not give the Tribunal the discretion to allow more than one year to appeal to the General Division.Footnote 3\n[25] For the reasons I have mentioned above and after reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and considering the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of his application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [26] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 52(2) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (DESD Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 52(2) of the DESD Act.\nFootnote 3\nB.

Conclusion\nDecision [1] Leave to appeal is refused. This means the appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) lost his job as a driver. The Claimant\u2019s employer said that he was let go because he sexually harassed the employee of a customer on his delivery route. The Claimant said that he never sexually harassed anyone. He argued that he was let go because he wanted to change routes and was asking for a raise.\n[3] The Respondent (Commission) determined that the Claimant was dismissed because he sexually harassed the employee of a customer on his delivery route. It decided that the Claimant lost his job because of misconduct and disqualified him from receiving EI benefits. After an unsuccessful reconsideration, the Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant lost his job because he was harassing a customer\u2019s employee. The General Division found that the Claimant knew or should have known that he could lose his job because he had received prior warnings. It found that this was the reason why he was let go. The General Division concluded that the Claimant lost his job because of misconduct.\n[5] The Claimant now seeks leave to appeal of the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division. The Claimant was asked to provide his grounds of appeal before November 15, 2023. He did not do so. He was granted an extension of time to submit his grounds of appeal until December 5, 2023. To this date, the Claimant has not provided his grounds of appeal.\n[6] I must decide whether the Claimant raised some reviewable error of the General Division upon which the appeal might succeed.\n[7] I refuse leave to appeal because the Claimant\u2019s appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [8] Does the Claimant raise some reviewable error of the General Division upon which the appeal might succeed?\nAnalysis [9] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are that:\nThe General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue that it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[10] An application for leave to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met on the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the leave to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error. In other words, that there is arguably some reviewable error upon which the appeal might succeed.\n[11] Therefore, before I can grant leave, I need to be satisfied that the reasons for appeal fall within any of the above-mentioned grounds of appeal and that at least one of the reasons has a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant raise some reviewable error of the General Division upon which the appeal might succeed? [12] The General Division had to decide whether the Claimant lost his job because of misconduct.\n[13] The General Division\u2019s role is to determine whether the employee\u2019s conduct amounted to misconduct within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act and not whether the severity of the penalty imposed by the employer was justified or whether the employee\u2019s conduct was a valid ground for dismissal.\n[14] The General Division must decide the issue before it based on the evidence presented by the parties.\n[15] The General Division found that the Claimant lost his job because he was harassing a customer\u2019s employee on his delivery route. The General Division found that the Claimant knew or should have known that he could lose his job because he had received prior warnings. It found that this was the reason why he was let go. The General Division concluded that the Claimant lost his job because of misconduct.\n[16] The General Division gave more weight to the employer\u2019s evidence. It considered that the Claimant was fired the day after the employer got a complaint about one of its drivers sexually harassing a customer\u2019s employee and was contacted by the police. It also considered that employer\u2019s evidence was supported by the timeline of events, the email from the customer, and the evidence of the employer\u2019s investigation of the complaint.\n[17] The evidence shows that the Claimant knew that harassment was unacceptable. He had received prior warnings, including one not to harass customers. The evidence before the General Division supports its conclusion that the Claimant knew or should have known that his actions could lead to his dismissal.\n[18] I see no reviewable error made by the General Division. It made its decision based on the evidence before it, and the decision complies with both the legislative provisions and the case law regarding misconduct.\n[19] Unfortunately, for the Claimant, an appeal to the Appeal Division is not an appeal in which there is a new hearing where a party can re-present their evidence and hope for a favourable decision.\n[20] After reviewing the appeal file and the General Division\u2019s decision as well as considering the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of his request for leave to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. The Claimant has not set out a reason, which falls into the above-enumerated grounds of appeal that could possibly lead to the reversal of the disputed decision.\nConclusion [21] Leave to appeal is refused. This means the appeal will not proceed.\n",

B.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (555959) dated December 20, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Angela Ryan Bourgeois\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 29, 2024\nHearing participant: Appellant\nDecision date: February 14, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-3591\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Preliminary Matters Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is dismissed. The Tribunal disagrees with the Appellant.\n[2] The Appellant hasn\u2019t shown just cause (in other words, a reason the law accepts) for leaving her job when she did. The Appellant didn\u2019t have just cause because she had reasonable alternatives to leaving. This means she is disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\nOverview [3] The Appellant was a continuing care assistant (CCA). In September 2021, she started a two-year program to become a licenced practical nurse. During the first year of her studies, she continued to work as a CCA.\n[4] However, the second year of her course, which started in September 2022, was more demanding.\n[5] So, she talked to her employer about her position. They decided that the Appellant would leave her position as a Care Team Assistant, which was an indeterminate, part-time (.8) position, and accept a casual position.Footnote 1\n[6] The change allowed the Appellant to work fewer hours to accommodate the increased demands of her course. It also gave the employer more flexibility to schedule the Appellant\u2019s shifts around her course.\n[7] The Appellant applied for EI benefits on September 17, 2022.\n[8] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that the Appellant voluntarily left (or chose to quit) her job without just cause, so it couldn\u2019t pay her benefits.\n[9] I must decide whether the Appellant voluntarily left her job, and if so, whether she has proven that she had no reasonable alternative to leaving her job.\n[10] The Commission says that the Appellant made a personal decision to leave her full-time employment to return to school, as she wanted a new career. It says that going from a full-time position to a casual position was a personal decision that does not amount to just cause.Footnote 2\n[11] The Appellant disagrees. She says she wasn\u2019t unemployed. She dropped from a .8 to a casual position. She didn\u2019t have to reapply.Footnote 3\nPreliminary Matters The issue in this appeal [12] The Appellant appealed two of the Commission\u2019s decisions to the Tribunal, availability and voluntarily leaving.\n[13] Another member of the General Division decided both issues. The Commission appealed that member\u2019s decision about the voluntarily leaving issue to the Appeal Division. The Appeal Division set aside the General Division\u2019s decision about the voluntarily leaving issue and referred the matter back to the General Division for reconsideration. So, the only issue before me is whether the Appellant voluntarily left her job, and if so, whether she had just cause to do so.\nIssue [14] I must decide:\nDid the Appellant voluntarily leave her job? If so, did she have just cause for leaving?\nAnalysis The Appellant voluntarily left her job [15] I find that the Appellant voluntarily left her job.\n[16] The Appellant says that she didn\u2019t quit her job. She and her employer had a conversation about her employment and her course. They knew that she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue to work at the same location after she graduated.Footnote 4 They decided that the best way to accommodate her course was for her to switch her part-time position to a casual position.Footnote 5 Before the employer agreed to the switch, the Appellant had to agree to scheduled work over the Christmas holidays.\n[17] So, the Appellant\u2019s position was changed from a part-time position to a casual position. The employer sent the Appellant a letter confirming that her part-time position ended effective September 24, 2022, along with her medical, dental and other benefits. The letter confirmed that the Appellant would remain as a casual Care Team Assistant at the same location.Footnote 6\n[18] The employer told the Commission that the Appellant quit one position and started a new position. It wasn\u2019t just the hours that changed.Footnote 7 The Commission says that this is voluntarily leaving a job.\n[19] I agree with the Commission that the Appellant voluntarily left her job. My reasons follow.\n[20] First, I find that the Appellant\u2019s move from a part-time position to a casual position was a change in jobs, not just hours. The Appellant moved from a position with guaranteed hours and benefits to a position where she wasn\u2019t assured of any hours and had no benefits. The employer\u2019s letter makes it clear that the employer considered that she had terminated her part-time position.\n[21] The Appellant says that she was never unemployed. She immediately moved from the part-time position to the casual position. There is no dispute that she remained employed with the employer. But there was still a separation of employment, however brief, when she moved from one position to another, with new terms of employment.\n[22] Secondly, it was the Appellant\u2019s choice to leave the part-time position for the casual position.\n[23] According to the Federal Court of Appeal, \u201cthe determination of whether an employee has voluntarily left his employment is a simple one. The question to be asked is as follows: did the employee have a choice to stay or to leave?\u201dFootnote 8\n[24] Although the Appellant and her employer came up with the solution together, the Appellant confirmed that it was her decision alone to leave the part-time position and move to the casual position.\n[25] Since the Appellant could have stayed in the part-time position but chose to leave for the casual position, I find that she voluntarily left the part-time position. She voluntarily left her employment.\nWhat it means to have just cause [26] The law says that you are disqualified from receiving benefits if you left your job voluntarily and you didn\u2019t have just cause.Footnote 9 Having a good reason for leaving a job isn\u2019t enough to prove just cause.\n[27] The law says that you have just cause to leave if you had no reasonable alternative to quitting your job when you did. It says that you have to consider all the circumstances.Footnote 10\n[28] It is up to the Appellant to prove that she had just cause.Footnote 11 She has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that she has to show that it is more likely than not that her only reasonable option was to quit. When I decide whether the Appellant had just cause, I have to look at all the circumstances that existed when the Appellant quit.\nWhy the Appellant left her job [29] The Appellant told me that she left the part-time job for the casual position because of her course. Also, she felt she had an obligation to her employer \u2013 she couldn\u2019t call in sick to take her course.\n[30] I accept that this is why she left her job. There is no evidence to make me question what she told me.\nThe Appellant didn\u2019t have a referral to take the course [31] Sometimes, the Commission (or a program the Commission authorizes) refers people to take training, a program, or a course. One of the circumstances I must consider is whether the Commission referred the Appellant to take her course.\n[32] The Appellant didn\u2019t have a referral. She reported on her application form that she tried to get a referral but wasn\u2019t approved.Footnote 12\nReasonable assurance of another employment in the immediate future [33] Another circumstance I must consider is whether the Appellant had a reasonable assurance of another job in the immediate future.Footnote 13\n[34] I find that she did. She knew before leaving her part-time job that she would be working in the casual position, and that she would have full-time hours over the Christmas holidays.\nThe Appellant had a reasonable alternative to leaving [35] A reasonable alternative to leaving her part-time job was to stay employed.\n[36] Case law says:\nIf you quit your job to take a course without a referral, you don\u2019t have just cause for leaving your job.Footnote 14 It is legitimate for someone to want to improve their life by changing the nature of their work, and return to school, but they cannot expect the employment insurance fund to bear the cost of that legitimate desire.Footnote 15 The assurance of an employment that doesn\u2019t pay enough and requires reliance on employment insurance benefits doesn\u2019t provide a claimant with a basis for leaving a job to return to school and make the employment insurance system bear the cost.Footnote 16\n[37] This case law applies to the Appellant\u2019s situation and doesn\u2019t allow me to find that she had just cause for leaving her job.\n[38] Considering all the circumstances, the Appellant hasn\u2019t proven that she had just cause to leave her job. She left her job because she wanted to complete her training, but she didn\u2019t have a referral for the course. And although she had a reasonable assurance of another job, that other job was a casual position that, from the start, required reliance on EI benefits.\n[39] I understand that the Appellant had good reasons for leaving her job to take a course. But this was a personal choice, and it goes against the idea behind the EI plan.Footnote 17\n[40] Since the Appellant had a reasonable alternative to leaving (to continue to work), she didn\u2019t have just cause to leave her job.\nConclusion [41] I find that the Appellant voluntarily left her employment without just cause. This means that she is disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\n[42] The appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nAll CCA positions with the employer are at .8 or lower.\nFootnote 2\nSee page GD4B-3 and GD4B-4.

The Tribunal agrees with the Appellant.\n[2] The Appellant has shown that she was available for work while in school. This means that she isn\u2019t disentitled from receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. So, the Appellant may be entitled to benefits.\nOverview [3] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that the Appellant was disentitled from receiving EI regular benefits from September 7, 2021, to June 30, 2022, because she wasn\u2019t available for work. A claimant has to be available for work to get EI regular benefits. Availability is an ongoing requirement. This means that a claimant has to be searching for a job.\n[4] I have to decide whether the Appellant has proven that she was available for work. The Appellant has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that she has to show that it is more likely than not that she was available for work.\n[5] The Commission says that the Appellant wasn\u2019t available because she was in school full-time and only made limited efforts to find work.\n[6] The Appellant disagrees and says that she was actively seeking a full-time job. She was working part-time and kept looking for work. Her school wasn\u2019t a restriction on her availability.\nMatter I have to consider first The Appellant\u2019s appeal was returned from the Appeal Division [7] The Appellant first appealed the Commission\u2019s decision that she wasn\u2019t available for work to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division in February 2023. She told the Tribunal about her availability and job search efforts.\n[8] The General Division decided the Appellant hadn\u2019t shown she was available for work. The Appellant appealed this decision to the Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division.\n[9] The Appeal Division decided the General Division had failed to properly consider the Appellant\u2019s evidence about her job search and availability for work. By doing so, it had made an important error.\n[10] The Appeal Division ordered the appeal to be returned to the General Division for a new hearing. This decision is a result of that hearing.\nIssue [11] Was the Appellant available for work while in school?\nAnalysis [12] Two different sections of the law require Appellants to show that they are available for work. The Commission decided that the Appellant was disentitled under both of these sections. So, she has to meet the criteria of both sections to get benefits.\n[13] First, the Employment Insurance Act (Act) says that a claimant has to prove that they are making \u201creasonable and customary efforts\u201d to find a suitable job.Footnote 1 The Employment Insurance Regulations (Regulations) give criteria that help explain what \u201creasonable and customary efforts\u201d mean.Footnote 2 I will look at those criteria below.\n[14] Second, the Act says that a claimant has to prove that they are \u201ccapable of and available for work\u201d but aren\u2019t able to find a suitable job.Footnote 3 Case law gives three things a claimant has to prove to show that they are \u201cavailable\u201d in this sense.Footnote 4 I will look at those factors below.\n[15] The Commission decided that the Appellant was disentitled from receiving benefits because she wasn\u2019t available for work based on these two sections of the law.\n[16] In addition, the Federal Court of Appeal has said that Appellants who are in school full-time are presumed to be unavailable for work.Footnote 5 This is called \u201cpresumption of non-availability.\u201d It means we can suppose that students aren\u2019t available for work when the evidence shows that they are in schoo full\u2011time.\n[17] I will start by looking at whether I can presume that the Appellant wasn\u2019t available for work. Then, I will look at whether hehe was available based on the two sections of the law on availability.\nPresuming full-time students aren\u2019t available for work [18] The presumption that students aren\u2019t available for work applies only to full-time students. The Appellant was a full-time high school student, so this presumption applies to her.\n[19] The presumption that full-time students aren\u2019t available for work can be rebutted (that is, shown to not apply). If the presumption were rebutted, it would not apply.\n[20] There are two ways the Appellant can rebut the presumption. She can show that she has a history of working full-time while also in school.Footnote 6 Or, she can show that there are exceptional circumstances in her case.Footnote 7\n[21] The Appellant has a history of working while in school. She was working part-time at a convenience store since March 2021. She continued working in this job throughout the following school year, too.\n[22] The Appellant had a flexible school schedule. Her classes were available online due to COVID-19 measures. She did not have scheduled classes with mandatory attendance. This means she could view the recordings of the classes at any time and do her schoolwork on her own schedule.\n[23] The Appellant has shown that there are exceptional circumstances in her case. First, she was able to work while attending school full-time. And second, she could view her recorded class and do her schoolwork at any time. Her ability to maintain her employment while in school and her flexible course schedule are enough to rebut the presumption of non-availability.\n[24] Rebutting the presumption means only that the Appellant isn\u2019t presumed to be unavailable. I still have to look at the two sections of the law that apply in this case and decide whether the Appellant is actually available.\nReasonable and customary efforts to find a job [25] The first section of the law that I am going to consider says that Appellants have to prove that their efforts to find a job were reasonable and customary.Footnote 8\n[26] The law sets out criteria for me to consider when deciding whether the Appellant\u2019s efforts were reasonable and customary.Footnote 9 I have to look at whether her efforts were sustained and whether they were directed toward finding a suitable job. In other words, the Appellant has to have kept trying to find a suitable job.\n[27] I also have to consider the Appellant\u2019s efforts to find a job. The Regulations list nine job\u2011search activities I have to consider. Some examples of those are the following:Footnote 10\nassessing employment opportunities networking contacting employers who may be hiring\n[28] The Commission says that the Appellant didn\u2019t do enough to try to find a job.\n[29] The Appellant disagrees. She was actively seeking work. She testified that she was looking for jobs that she was qualified to do. This meant she was mainly applying at fast food restaurants and retail stores.\n[30] She had a resume prepared and dropped it off at six employers that she knew were open and may be hiring. She and her mother checked online for new job postings on a daily basis. She networked with friends and family members to find out about prospective jobs.\n[31] The Commission argued the Appellant\u2019s job search efforts were insufficient because she only applied at six employers during this time.\n[32] I recognize that applying for six jobs over a period of ten months may seem like a limited job search. However, I consider that the Appellant was applying for jobs during a time of extraordinary restrictions on businesses.\n[33] The Appellant\u2019s mother testified that there were few businesses that many employers were closed or weren\u2019t hiring during this time due to COVID-19 restrictions. She also pointed out that the Appellant was still a high school student and had few qualifications for jobs outside of the restaurant and retail industries. She said the Appellant was applying for every job that she could. Not only that, but the Appellant was also re-visiting each of the employers that she had applied with and asking if there were any new openings.\n[34] The Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was credible. She gave a detailed account of the Appellant\u2019s job search efforts and availability for work. She was able to answer questions about the Appellant\u2019s job search in an open and direct manner.\n[35] I put weight on the Appellant and her mother\u2019s testimony at the hearing about what job search efforts she made and the limitations on the jobs that were available at the time.\n[36] I find the Appellant made reasonable and customary efforts to find work. She made a number of job search efforts and was seeking suitable employment by applying for jobs that she was qualified for. The evidence supports that her efforts were sustained throughout the period in question.\nCapable of and available for work [37] I also have to consider whether the Appellant was capable of and available for work but unable to find a suitable job.Footnote 11 Case law sets out three factors for me to consider when deciding this. The Appellant has to prove the following three things:Footnote 12\na) She wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available. b) She has made efforts to find a suitable job. c) She didn\u2019t set personal conditions that might have unduly (in other words, overly) limited her chances of going back to work.\n[38] When I consider each of these factors, I have to look at the Appellant\u2019s attitude and conduct.Footnote 13\nWanting to go back to work [39] The Appellant has shown that she wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available.\n[40] She was actively seeking work on a regular basis. She contacted prospective employers and applied for jobs. She testified that work was her priority. So, even though she was working part-time, she kept looking for another part-time or full-time job.\n[41] The Appellant\u2019s efforts to find work show that\u2019s he wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available.\nMaking efforts to find a suitable job [42] The Appellant has made enough effort to find a suitable job.\n[43] I have considered the list of job-search activities given above in deciding this second factor. For this factor, that list is for guidance only.Footnote 14\n[44] The Appellant\u2019s efforts to find a new job included having a resume prepared, assessing employment opportunities on a regular basis, networking, contacting prospective employers, as well as applying for jobs. I explained these reasons above when looking at whether the Appellant has made reasonable and customary efforts to find a job.\n[45] I believe the Appellant was looking for work. She made reasonable efforts to find suitable employment. She has met this factor.\nUnduly limiting chances of going back to work [46] The Appellant didn\u2019t set personal conditions that might have unduly limited her chances of going back to work.\n[47] The Commission says the Appellant\u2019s school attendance was a personal condition that limited her chances of finding work:\n[48] When the Appellant first applied for benefits, she filled out a training questionnaire. The questionnaire asked what she would do if she found a full-time job that conflicted with her school obligations. The Appellant answered that she would leave school to accept the job.\n[49] The Appellant said the same thing when asked this question by the Commission. She told both the Commission and the Tribunal that work was her priority. She pointed out that she had over 200 absences from school during this year because she chose to work rather than attend school. When she was offered shifts that conflicted with her school, she chose to work the shifts.\n[50] Further, the Appellant explained that her school obligations were very flexible and would not have limited her ability to accept a full-time job. Her courses were available online; these could be viewed and the classwork completed at any time.\n[51] I believe the Appellant. She provided credible testimony of the nature of her courses and her ability to balance full-time work with her school obligations. Her testimony is supported by the Appellant applying for both full-time and part-time jobs while she was in school.\n[52] For these reasons, I find the Appellant\u2019s school attendance was not a personal condition that might have unduly limited her chances of finding work.\nSo, was the Appellant capable of and available for work? [53] Based on my findings on the three factors, I find that the Appellant has shown that she was capable of and available for work but unable to find a suitable job.\nConclusion [54] The Appellant has shown that she was available for work within the meaning of the law. Because of this, I find that the Appellant isn\u2019t disentitled from receiving benefits. So, the Appellant may be entitled to benefits.\n[55] This means that the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 50(8) of the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 9.001 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (Regulations).\nFootnote 3\nSee section 18(1)(a) of the Act.\nFootnote 4\nSee Faucher v Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, A-56-96 and A-57-96.\nFootnote 5\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Cyrenne, 2010 FCA 349.\nFootnote 6\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Rideout, 2004 FCA 304.\nFootnote 7\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Cyrenne, 2010 FCA 349.\nFootnote 8\nSee section 50(8) of the Act.\nFootnote 9\nSee section 9.001 of the Regulations.\nFootnote 10\nSee section 9.001 of the Regulations.\nFootnote 11\nSee section 18(1)(a) of the Act.\nFootnote 12\nThese three factors appear in Faucher v Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, A-56-96 and A\u201157\u201196.

The Tribunal agrees with the Appellant.\n[2] The Tribunal finds that the Appellant didn\u2019t voluntarily leave his job. So, he isn\u2019t disqualified (or disentitled) from receiving regular Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\nOverview [3] This appeal is about whether the Appellant voluntarily left his job without just cause.\n[4] The Appellant worked as a farm labourer in Canada under the foreign workers\u2019 program. From 2019 until 2022, he did seasonal farm work, moving from one farm to another, from April until November. He returned to his home country during the months he wasn\u2019t working.\n[5] The 2022 season started like other seasons. In April 2022, he was in Canada living in a bunkhouse on his employer\u2019s farm, but the work had yet to start. In talking to someone at Service Canada, he learned that he could apply for EI benefits. So, he applied, and established a claim as of April 24, 2022. He told his coworkers that they could also apply.\n[6] The Appellant reapplied for benefits (filed a renewal claim) on July 4, 2022, after his employment ended on June 28, 2022.\n[7] At first, the Commission decided that the Appellant could get EI benefits. It changed its mind after the employer asked the Commission to reconsider its decision. After reconsidering its decision, the Commission decided that it couldn\u2019t pay the Appellant EI benefits because he didn\u2019t have just cause to voluntarily leave his job.\n[8] The General Division of the Tribunal agreed that the Appellant didn\u2019t have just cause to voluntarily leave his job. The Appellant appealed the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division. The Appeal Division decided that the General Division made errors of law and returned the matter to be reconsidered.\n[9] So, I must decide if the Appellant voluntarily left his job, and if he did, whether he had just cause to do so. To have just cause means that he had no reasonable alternative to leaving when he did.\nIssues [10] I must answer these questions:\na) Did the Appellant voluntarily leave his job? b) If so, did he have just cause to do so? In other words, did he have no reasonable alternative to leaving? c) If he didn\u2019t have just cause, did he leave within three weeks from when his employment was scheduled to end?\nAnalysis Did the Appellant voluntarily leave his job? [11] No. I find that the Appellant stopped working when his job ended.\nWhat it means to voluntarily leave a job [12] The law says that when I decide if the Appellant voluntarily left his job, I must consider whether he had the choice to stay or to leave.Footnote 1 If he had the choice to stay and did not, then he voluntarily left his job.\n[13] The Commission must prove that it is more likely than not that the Appellant voluntarily left his job.\nThe Appellant didn\u2019t voluntarily leave his job [14] The Appellant didn\u2019t voluntarily leave his job because he didn\u2019t have the choice to stay. His employment ended on June 28, 2022, when the employer eliminated his shift. As I explain below, I considered the contract, the Appellant\u2019s job, and the statements and actions of the Appellant and the employer.\nThe contract [15] The Appellant\u2019s contract ended on July 11, 2022. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the employer had work for the Appellant until then, or that his job didn\u2019t end on June 28, 2022. This is because the employer only paid the Appellant for the hours he worked. For example, when the Appellant first arrived at the farm in April 2022, he was under contract, but there was little work until the second week of May, so he wasn\u2019t paid. Footnote 2\nWhat the Appellant did for the employer [16] The Appellant\u2019s job was to read the scale in the barn. It is a two-person job and there is only one scale. During peak season, there were two shifts, so four people did that specific job. After June 28, 2022, the employer ran only one shift \u2013 the shift the Appellant wasn\u2019t working.\n[17] When the employer reduced his position to one shift a day, the Appellant said he knew his job was over, and he stopped going to the barn to work. He learned about the change from another employee.\nWhat they say happened [18] The Appellant says that the employer told him that he wasn\u2019t entitled to EI benefits. The employer was upset with the Appellant because he applied for EI benefits and told others about their entitlement to benefits.\n[19] The Appellant says the employer didn\u2019t like Service Canada contacting its office and asking questions. The Appellant explained that while the employer pays all the hours they work, it doesn\u2019t pay every hour in the right pay period. The employer holds back pay for the extra hours its employees work at peak season and pays it later towards the end of the season, when the work is slower.Footnote 3 For this reason, the employer didn\u2019t want Service Canada looking into its operations.\n[20] The Appellant says that although he got along with the employer in earlier years, after the employer learned that the Appellant had applied for benefits and had told others how to apply, the employer started referring to him as the \u201csmart one.\u201d The employer would talk to others within the Appellant\u2019s hearing and say things like \u201cthe Appellant wouldn\u2019t be working there again\u201d and that \u201che couldn\u2019t wait for the Appellant to stop working.\u201d Footnote 4 The Appellant says when the employer entered the barn where he worked, he would greet the employer, but despite hearing him, the employer ignored him. He says the employer told him he was free to stop working whenever he wanted, and that he wouldn\u2019t help the Appellant find another farm job.\n[21] The Appellant stated that around June 24, 2022, the employer sent another employee to watch the Appellant work so he could learn the Appellant\u2019s job for the following season. The other employee told the Appellant that the employer said it had signed the Appellant off (in other words, it had released him from his contract).\n[22] As far as the Appellant knows, none of his coworkers who applied for EI benefits were rehired in 2023.\n[23] To the Commission, the employer denied telling the Appellant that he wouldn\u2019t be rehired the next year.\n[24] The employer told the Commission that the Appellant\u2019s evening shift was cancelled on June 28, 2022, because the season was ending, but the Appellant was expected to show up for the 6 a.m. shift.Footnote 5 The employer told the Commission that the Appellant stopped working because he didn\u2019t want to do the job anymore.Footnote 6 The employer says that no one realized the Appellant wasn\u2019t working until a few days had passed.Footnote 7\n[25] I find that the employer\u2019s statements are unreliable and not credible.\n[26] First, the record of employment prepared by the employer for the Appellant doesn\u2019t reflect what the employer told the Commission. The employer told the Commission that the Appellant didn\u2019t have much work until May 9, 2022, yet his record of employment shows that he worked more hours during those first two pay periods starting on April 22, 2022, than he did in weeks three, four, five, six, eight, nine and ten.Footnote 8 The time sheets provided by the employer suggest that the Appellant only started work on May 9, 2022.Footnote 9 If this is true, based on the number of pay periods on the record of employment, the Appellant would have worked beyond June 28, 2022, which we know isn\u2019t true. So, the employer\u2019s statements and its record of employment can\u2019t both be true. This is the main reason I find the employer\u2019s statements are unreliable.\n[27] Secondly, I don\u2019t believe that the Appellant could have missed days of work without the employer noticing, as the employer claims happened. This is why:\nIt is unreasonable to think that half of a two-person team not showing up for work would go unnoticed for an hour, let alone the days the employer claims. The Appellant worked in the barn, not in the field, and if he had been scheduled to work and didn\u2019t show up, the product wouldn\u2019t have been weighed and stored. As I say, this wouldn\u2019t have gone unnoticed for days. If the employer had scheduled the Appellant to work, his supervisor would have walked the few minutes from the barn to the Appellant\u2019s bunkhouse and asked him why he wasn\u2019t at work. The Appellant\u2019s supervisor lived in a bunkhouse next to the Appellant and they were close to the barn. So, it isn\u2019t credible that the employer didn\u2019t know the Appellant wasn\u2019t at work. Even if the employer intended the Appellant to work in the field after June 28, 2022, it is still unlikely that his absence went unnoticed for days. If nothing else, his supervisor would have noticed that he was still at the bunkhouse, and not working.\n[28] I find that the employer waited a few days then reported the Appellant's absence in hopes that the Appellant wouldn\u2019t be entitled to EI benefits. Such an action is in line with the animosity he showed the Appellant since he learned the Appellant had applied for EI benefits. The employer\u2019s request for reconsideration of the Commission\u2019s decision to pay the Appellant EI benefits also shows that he was against the Appellant receiving benefits.\n[29] When the Appellant filed his renewal application, he reported that he stopped working because of a shortage of work. I find that this shows that until the Commission started probing into why he left, the Appellant believed that his job had come to its natural ending.\n[30] The Commission says the Appellant admitted to the Jamaican Liaison officer that he knew he had to work but stopped going because he was expecting to start another job.Footnote 10 The Appellant denies having said this. He says he agreed that he breached the contract because he just wanted to get it over with.\n[31] I prefer the Appellant\u2019s original statement to the Commission that he stopped working because of a shortage of work to what the Commission says the Jamaican Liaison officer said.\n[32] The Appellant\u2019s original statement to the Commission is in line with his testimony.\n[33] In the circumstances, I find it unlikely that the Appellant would have deliberately stopped showing up for scheduled work. He was reliant upon the employer to drive him to his next employer, for transportation for groceries, and for his accommodations, which was at the workplace.\n[34] Considering all the evidence, the Appellant\u2019s explanation of what happened is more likely than the employer\u2019s version of events.\n[35] So I find that the Appellant\u2019s job ended on June 28, 2022. Since the Appellant didn\u2019t have the choice to stay employed, he didn\u2019t voluntarily leave his job. This means that he isn\u2019t disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\n[36] That said, I am also going to consider whether the Appellant would have had just cause to leave his job.\nDid the Appellant have just cause to leave his job? What it means to have just cause [37] The law says that you are disqualified from receiving benefits if you left your job voluntarily and you didn\u2019t have just cause.Footnote 11 Having a good reason for leaving a job isn\u2019t enough to prove just cause.\n[38] The law explains what it means by \u201cjust cause.\u201d The law says that you have just cause to leave if you had no reasonable alternative to quitting your job when you did. It says that you must consider all the circumstances.Footnote 12\n[39] It is up to the Appellant to prove that he had just cause. He must prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that he must show that it is more likely than not that his only reasonable option was to quit.Footnote 13\n[40] When I decide whether the Appellant had just cause, I must look at all the circumstances that existed when the Appellant quit. The law sets out some circumstances I must look at.Footnote 14\n[41] After I decide which circumstances apply to the Appellant, he then must show that he had no reasonable alternative to leaving at that time.Footnote 15\nWhat else happened [42] As mentioned above, the Appellant says that after the employer learned that the Appellant had applied for EI benefits, and had told others how to apply, the employer\u2019s conduct towards the Appellant changed. Specifically, the employer:\nIgnored the Appellant when the Appellant greeted him Made comments in front of others that the Appellant was the smart one, that he wouldn\u2019t be rehired, and that the employer would be happy when the Appellant was done\n[43] The employer called the Jamaican Liaison Office and reported that the Appellant had breached his contract.\n[44] The employer also asked the Commission to reconsider its decision to pay the Appellant EI benefits. In its request for reconsideration, the employer alleged that the Appellant remained in Ontario illegally.Footnote 16\n[45] The Appellant says that when he talked to the Jamaican Liaison Office he agreed that he had breached the contract because the office always takes the employer\u2019s side.Footnote 17 He says the fact that the officer didn\u2019t return his calls but promptly replied to the employer is proof of this.Footnote 18 He says the only thing the liaison officer wanted to know from him was when he wanted to leave Canada.\n[46] The Appellant believes that the employer interfered with the next farm job he was going to do.\n[47] The employer told the Commission that he was annoyed that the Appellant asked its office staff for letters for his benefits and that he avoided the Appellant. It denied saying that the Appellant wouldn\u2019t be rehired and holding his application for benefits against him.Footnote 19\nSpecific circumstances that I must consider [48] Based on the evidence in the file, I have to consider some of the circumstances set out in the Employment Insurance Act, including whether there was antagonism and harassment.Footnote 20\n[49] First, I find that there was antagonism with a supervisor for which the Appellant was not primarily responsible.Footnote 21\n[50] I accept what the Appellant told me about how the employer treated him. As explained above, the employer\u2019s statements are not credible. I believe the employer\u2019s negative treatment towards the Appellant was meant to deter other workers from applying for benefits the employer feels they aren\u2019t entitled to. There is no compelling evidence that the Appellant was responsible for the way the employer treated him.\n[51] Secondly, I find that the employer\u2019s actions also amount to harassment. His verbal behaviour was meant to humiliate the Appellant and persisted from when the employer learned that the Appellant applied for EI benefits until after the Appellant stopped working.\n[52] Thirdly, I also thought about whether the employer\u2019s practices may have been contrary to the law.Footnote 22 The employer didn\u2019t pay the Appellant for his work in the correct pay periods, and the Appellant normally worked seven days a week.Footnote 23 But the Appellant hasn\u2019t provided enough evidence to show that this practice is contrary to the law, and hasn\u2019t specified what law the employer\u2019s practices breach.\n[53] Lastly, the Commission says that the Appellant didn\u2019t have a reasonable assurance of another job in the immediate future.Footnote 24 The Appellant didn\u2019t dispute this. And I see no evidence to the contrary.\nThe Appellant had no reasonable alternative [54] I must now look at whether the Appellant would have had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job when he did.\n[55] I find that the Appellant would have had no reasonable alternative but to leave because of the employer\u2019s treatment towards him. He couldn\u2019t have continued to work for the employer given the ongoing comments and treatment. The negative treatment affected his mental health and was exacerbated by the fact that the Appellant lived where he worked. He didn\u2019t have a break because he lived with those who heard the employer\u2019s words and witnessed his antagonistic and harassing treatment of the Appellant. In other words, staying until he had another job wasn\u2019t a reasonable alternative.\n[56] The Commission says that the Appellant could have reported the situation to the Jamaican Liaison Office.Footnote 25\n[57] Talking to the Jamaican Liaison Office wouldn\u2019t have helped the Appellant. I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that despite the fees he paid to the office, the office regularly takes the employer\u2019s side because if it didn\u2019t, the employer would use a different agency to help it find workers. The officer didn\u2019t return his calls, and when she talked to him at the employer\u2019s request, she didn\u2019t ask his side of the story. She didn\u2019t allow him to explain that the photo of him she claimed had been taken at Niagara Falls while he was supposed to be working was taken the year before. So, it\u2019s likely the officer would not have been interested in anything the Appellant had to say before his job ended.\n[58] The Commission says that since the Jamaican Liaison officer wasn\u2019t returning his calls, the Appellant could have visited the Jamaican Liaison Office in person. This isn\u2019t a reasonable alternative because the Appellant had no realistic means to get to the office. The Appellant lived and worked in the country, about a two-hour car drive from the office. As far as the Appellant knows, there was no public transportation there. He relied on his employer for all his transportation needs, from getting groceries, to getting to his next employer. Further, most weeks he was working seven days a week. The idea that he could have attended the office is unrealistic, so it wasn\u2019t a reasonable alternative.\n[59] Since the Appellant had no reasonable alternatives, he would have had just cause for leaving his job.\nLeaving a job within three weeks of its end [60] The Appeal division wanted me to consider whether the Appellant would have been disentitled to EI benefits only until his contract would have ended.\n[61] Despite its reconsideration decision, the Commission now believes that the Appellant shouldn\u2019t be \u201cdisqualified\u201d from receiving EI benefits, but should be \u201cdisentitled\u201d only from June 28, 2022, to July 11, 2022.\n[62] This is because the Act says that claimants who voluntarily leave their job without just cause within three weeks before their term of employment is to end are disentitled from receiving EI benefits only until their employment was scheduled to end.Footnote 26\n[63] As explained above, the Appellant would have had just cause for leaving his job had it not already ended.\n[64] But if he hadn\u2019t had just cause, I agree with the Commission that his job would have otherwise ended on July 11, 2022, which was within three weeks from when he stopped working. The Appellant agrees that this is when his contract was meant to end.Footnote 27 So, if he hadn\u2019t had just cause, he would have been disentitled from receiving EI benefits from June 28, 2022, to July 11, 2022.\nConclusion [65] The Appellant isn\u2019t disqualified from receiving benefits because he didn\u2019t voluntarily leave his job.\n[66] The appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nThe court said this in Canada (Attorney General) v Peace, 2004 FCA 56.\nFootnote 2\nThe employer told the Commission that there was little work until the second week of May 2022. See page GD3-26. The Appellant applied for EI benefits on April 29, 2022.\nFootnote 3\nThe Appellant told me that he tried to explain this to the Commission, but its officer didn\u2019t understand what he was saying.\nFootnote 4\nFor example, see what the Appellant told the Commission on page GD3-38 and GD3-42, and what the Appellant told me at the hearing.\nFootnote 5\nSee page GD3-26.\nFootnote 6\nSee pages GD3-26 to GD3-27.\nFootnote 7\nSee GD3-26.

M.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 21, 2023 (GP-23-999)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: February 21, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-82\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing to give the Claimant (S. M.) leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not proceed. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] The Claimant applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension in February 2022. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused her application initially and in a reconsideration letter. The Claimant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to this Tribunal.\n[3] The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal, finding that she didn\u2019t show that her disability became severe within the meaning of the CPP by December 31, 1996, or anytime in 1997 up to October 31.\nIssues [4] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error by failing to provide the Claimant with a fair process? b) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error applying the law to the facts? c) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division that would justify granting permission to appeal?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [5] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[6] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[7] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence that would justify granting permission to appeal, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division failed to provide the Claimant with a fair process [8] The Claimant argues that she wasn\u2019t really prepared for her hearing at the General Division, that there is a lot more she could have said during the hearing.Footnote 3\n[9] What a fairness requires will vary depending on the circumstances.Footnote 4 At the heart of the question about fairness is whether, considering all the circumstances, the people impacted by the process had a meaningful opportunity to present their case fully and fairly.\n[10] Part of the duty to act fairly is allowing people the right to be heard. The right to be heard is also about giving people the chance to make arguments on every fact or factor likely to affect the decision.Footnote 5\n[11] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division failed to provide her with a fair process. The General Division started the hearing by explaining what the legal test was that the Claimant needed to meet. Then the Claimant gave her testimony.Footnote 6 She didn\u2019t raise any concern at the hearing about being unprepared in any way that might have triggered the General Division to proceed differently.\n[12] I cannot conclude that the General Division may have made an error about fair process. The Claimant hasn\u2019t provided any evidence of unfair process. My review of the record also doesn\u2019t suggest that the General Division might have failed to provide a fair process.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division made an error applying the law to the facts [13] The Claimant argues that she has medical conditions (two types of arthritis) and that she cannot work as a result. She says that considering her medical conditions, the General Division must have made an error by concluding that she wasn\u2019t eligible for the disability pension.Footnote 7\n[14] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error applying the law to the facts. The question before the General Division was more specific than simply whether the Claimant has any medical conditions that keep her from working currently.\n[15] The General Division explained that she had to show that her disability was severe and prolonged within the meaning of the CPP starting sometime during her coverage period and continuously since then.Footnote 8 Her coverage period is based on her contributions to the CPP.\n[16] Based on her contributions, the General Division explained that the Claimant\u2019s coverage period ended on December 31, 1996. She had some additional contributions to the CPP that were below the minimum that the CPP accepts, but those contributions meant that she could also show that her disability became severe and prolonged in 1997, sometime between January 1 and October 31.\n[17] I cannot conclude that the General Division made any error applying the CPP to facts about the Claimant\u2019s medical conditions.\n[18] The General Division clearly stated that the Claimant had lots of evidence that shows significant impairments at the time of the General Division hearing.Footnote 9 But the Claimant needed some medical evidence about what her medical conditions were like during the coverage period.Footnote 10 The documents about the Claimant\u2019s medical situation in 2014 and following didn\u2019t help her to show she was eligible for the disability pension because they focused on a much later period.\nThe Claimant provided new evidence, but it can\u2019t justify giving her permission to appeal [19] The Claimant provided new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division. The document the Claimant provided is a diagnostic imagining report of her spine dated February 12, 2024.Footnote 11\n[20] The report isn\u2019t relevant to the question of whether the Claimant had a disability that was severe and prolonged on or before December 31, 1996, or in 1997 by the end of October. The report describes the outcome of imaging from February 6, 2024 as compared to multiple prior studies, including August 17, 2021.\n[21] This report doesn\u2019t shed any light on the period the Appeal Division needs to consider, so providing it as new evidence cannot form the basis for granting the Claimant permission to appeal.\n[22] I\u2019ve reviewed the record.Footnote 12 I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence in the appeal. The Claimant has lots of medical diagnoses that affect her ability to work now, so the result here is difficult. But I don\u2019t have the ability to change how the law about contributions and coverage periods in the CPP apply to the Claimant.\nConclusion [23] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1-3.\nFootnote 4\nSee Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC).\nFootnote 5\nThe Federal Court explains this in a case called Kouama v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 9008 (FC).\nFootnote 6\nThe recording of the General Division hearing starts with the General Division member providing this information.\nFootnote 7\nSee AD1-3.\nFootnote 8\nSee paragraphs 7 and 8 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 9\nSee paragraph 22 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 10\nSee paragraphs 22 to 30 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 11\nSee AD1H-2.\nFootnote 12\nThis Federal Court set out its expectation for that kind of review by the Appeal Division in Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

M.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated October 27, 2023 (GE-23-2563)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 23, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-1112\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Conclusion\nDecision [1] The application for permission to appeal was not late. However, permission to appeal is not granted. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] On April 23, 2021, the Respondent (Commission) issued a decision saying that it was unable to pay the Applicant (Claimant) benefits from the start of her benefit period.\n[3] On July 26, 2023, the Claimant filled out a request for reconsideration form. The Commission decided that the Claimant had not demonstrated a continuing intention to challenge the initial decision. It decided not to extend the 30-day period to ask for a reconsideration of the April 23, 2021, decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Commission had exercised its discretion judicially when it refused to extend the 30-day period to ask for a reconsideration of the initial decision. This meant that it could not intervene.\n[5] The Claimant now seeks permission from the Appeal Division to appeal the General Division\u2019s decision. She argues that the General Division did not take into account the fact that she was not inactive. She made calls and looked for places to go. She says that she stopped working to care for her son because he was sick and was not allowed in daycare. She argues that she was entitled to benefits during that difficult time.\nIssue [6] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision.Footnote 1 These reviewable errors are the following:\nThe General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[7] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove her case; she must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, she has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[8] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [9] The Claimant argues that the General Division did not take into account the fact that she was not inactive. She made calls and looked for places to go to challenge the initial decision.\n[10] The Claimant says that she stopped working to care for her son because he was sick and was not allowed in daycare. She argues that she was entitled to benefits during that difficult time.\n[11] The General Division had to decide whether it was appropriate for the Tribunal to intervene in response to the Commission\u2019s refusal to extend the 30-day period to ask for a reconsideration.\n[12] The evidence shows that on April 23, 2021, the Commission issued a decision saying that it was unable to pay the Claimant benefits from the start of her benefit period. The Claimant did not file a request for reconsideration until July 26, 2023.\n[13] The Commission found that the Claimant did not have a reasonable explanation for the delay of more than two years and that she had not demonstrated a continuing intention to ask for a reconsideration.\n[14] Before the General Division, the Claimant\u2019s explanation for being late was that she simply did not know how to appeal the decision. She said that she had tried to find out, but people were not really helpful or told her that she had to wait. She said that she did not understand what she needed to do until she was told about the form in May 2023.\n[15] The General Division found that the Commission had considered these factors but decided that they could not reasonably explain a delay of more than two years.\n[16] Before the General Division, the Claimant acknowledged that she had received the Commission\u2019s initial decision, which clearly mentions the importance of the 30-day period and how to access a reconsideration form\u2014online, by phone, or by visiting a Service Canada Centre.\n[17] The initial decision says:\n[translation] Our decisions are based on the Employment Insurance Act and its Regulations. If you have already provided all pertinent information and still disagree with this (these) decision(s), you have 30 days following the date of this letter (or from the date you were verbally notified, whichever occurred first) to make a formal request for reconsideration to the Commission. For more information on how to request a reconsideration and to access the Request for Reconsideration of an Employment Insurance decision form, please visit www.canada.ca\/en\/services\/benefits\/ei\/ei-reconsideration.html, contact us at 1-800-808-6352 or visit the nearest Service Canada Centre.Footnote 2\n[18] The General Division decided that the Commission had properly exercised its discretion when it found that the Claimant did not have a reasonable explanation for the more than two-year delay in asking for a reconsideration and that she had not demonstrated a continuing intention to ask for a reconsideration. This meant that it had no power to change the initial decision.\n[19] I see no reviewable error made by the General Division. It properly applied the facts to the law in deciding that the Commission had acted judicially when it refused to give more time to ask for a reconsideration.\nConclusion [20] The application for permission to appeal was not late. However, permission to appeal is not granted. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD3-11.\n",

R.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated August 17, 2023 (GP-23-816)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: January 4, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-1024\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Next steps Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] J. R. (Claimant) applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension in May 2021. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused his application. The Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider. On December 17, 2021, the Minister wrote a reconsideration decision letter confirming the decision to refuse the disability pension.Footnote 1\n[3] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal on May 5, 2023.Footnote 2\nIssues [4] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made any error in its decision about the Claimant\u2019s late appeal? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [5] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if his application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 3\n[6] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 4\n[7] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division made an error about the Claimant\u2019s late appeal [8] The Claimant says that the delay in filing an appeal at the General Division was not all his fault, and that there was a disruption in the mail service at the beginning of the process. He says that some original papers were lost and came in late, but ultimately the Minister has all the documents related to the problem with his vision that caused him to apply for the disability pension.Footnote 5\n[9] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division.\n[10] Consistent with the General Division\u2019s decision, the Claimant had 90 days from when the Minister communicated its reconsideration decision to appeal to the General Division.Footnote 6 If a claimant is past the 90 days, the General Division can give a claimant an extension of time to appeal. However, in no case can a claimant appeal a reconsideration decision more than one year after the Minister communicated it to the Claimant.Footnote 7\n[11] The General Division considered the Claimant\u2019s position that he didn\u2019t receive the reconsideration letter until \u201cmonths after the date printed on the letter\u201d because there was a disruption with the mail service.Footnote 8 The General Division also noted that the Minister wrote to the Claimant again on August 22, 2022, refencing the duplicate medical report they received in April 2022 and the reconsideration decision from December 17, 2021.\n[12] The General Division found that even accounting for a matter of months after December 17, 2021, the Claimant was past the one-year deadline. In that case, the General Division didn\u2019t have the discretion to give the Claimant an extension of time.\n[13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised any argument about an error in the General Division\u2019s decision that has a reasonable chance of success. The General Division\u2019s decision already accounts for the mail delay, which is the issue the Claimant raises with the General Division\u2019s decision. The General Division didn\u2019t have the discretion to extend the time for filing past a year.\n[14] I have reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t misunderstand the evidence about the mail processing delay.Footnote 9 The General Division concluded that even including the mail delay, the Claimant was past the one-year deadline. In no case can an appeal go ahead when the claimant files it after the one-year deadline.\nNext steps [15] The documents in the Claimant\u2019s appeal suggested that his coverage period didn\u2019t end until December 31, 2023. And although one of the reasons he was denied for the disability pension in the past was that he was still working, he says that he is no longer working now.\n[16] The Claimant may wish to reapply for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension by filing a new application form.\nConclusion [17] Permission to appeal is refused. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee GD2-7.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD1.\nFootnote 3\nSee sections 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 4\nSee section 58.1(c) in the Act.\nFootnote 5\nSee AD1-4.\nFootnote 6\nSee section 52(1) in the Act.\nFootnote 7\nSee section 52(2) in the Act.\nFootnote 8\nSee GD1-6, and paragraphs 10 and 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 9\nThis kind of review of the evidence is anticipated by the Federal Court in a case called Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

J.\nRepresentative: Denis Monette\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated December 15, 2023 (GE-23-2319)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 26, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-57\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis I am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) stopped working for his employer. He applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\n[3] The Respondent (Commission) told him that he is not entitled to EI regular benefits because he voluntarily left his job for the employer without good cause under the law. The Claimant explained that he was dismissed and did not leave his job. On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job because he did not provide his employer with a medical certificate for the extension of his sick leave and did not return to his job at the end of his authorized leave. It found that the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving his job. He should have made sure that his leave was extended on time, or reported for work if it was not. The General Division found that the Claimant did not have just cause for leaving his job under the law.\n[5] The Claimant is now asking the Appeal Division for permission to appeal the General Division\u2019s decision. He argues that the employer could not assume that he had quit. He was on sick leave and did not intend to leave his job. The Claimant argues that the employer had an obligation to contact him before severing the employment relationship. It did not do so. So, it was a constructive dismissal.\nIssue [6] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [7] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\nThe General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[8] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that his appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[9] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [10] The Claimant argues that the employer could not assume that he had quit. He was on sick leave and did not intend to leave his job. The Claimant argues that the employer had an obligation to contact him before severing the employment relationship. It did not do so. So, it was a constructive dismissal.\n[11] The Federal Court of Appeal has decided that, even if the reason for the loss of employment is stated as either misconduct or voluntary leaving without just cause, the General Division\u2019s jurisdiction is to determine the merits of the disqualification from benefits.Footnote 1\n[12] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job because he did not provide his employer with a medical certificate for the extension of his sick leave and did not return to his job when his leave ended. It found that the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving his job. He should have made sure that his leave was extended on time, or reported for work if it was not. The General Division found that the Claimant did not have just cause for leaving his job under the law.\n[13] The evidence before the General Division shows that the Claimant\u2019s leave ended on December 23, 2022. He did not report for work at the end of his authorized sick leave. The Claimant extended his absence from work for a period that was not approved by his employer. So, he voluntarily left his job without just cause under the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\n[14] As the General Division decided, the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving his job. He should have made sure that his leave was extended on time, or reported for work if it was not.\n[15] In addition, the Claimant\u2019s mistake about his return-to-work date also shows carelessness about his obligations to his employer. A claimant\u2019s failure to call their employer to warn them of their absence, or an unauthorized absence from work, amounts to misconduct under the EI Act.Footnote 2\n[16] In my view, the General Division correctly set out the applicable legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and considered whether the Claimant, having considered all the circumstances, had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job.\n[17] An appeal to the Appeal Division is not an opportunity for the Claimant to reargue his case and hope for a different outcome. I find that the Claimant has not raised any question of law, fact, or jurisdiction that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\n[18] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [19] Permission to appeal is refused. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Easson (A-1598-92), Dufour (A-1398-92); and Eppel (A-3-95).\nFootnote 2\nUmpires have consistently held that the failure to call an employer to warn them of an absence amounts to misconduct under the Employment Insurance Act (CUB 18712, 18006, 17984, 26713, 32458 and 57141, 66436).\n",

The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) stopped working for his employer. He made a claim for Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits effective January 1, 2023.\n[3] The Respondent (Commission) told the Claimant that he was not entitled to EI benefits because he voluntarily left his employment with the employer without just cause as defined in the law. The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider. On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that he had reasonable alternatives to leaving.

He argues that the General Division exceeded its jurisdiction and made errors of fact and law.\nIssue [6] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision.

He argued that he did not leave to retire. He said that the work environment was toxic and that management bullied and threatened him at work for a long time.\n[11] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that after his manager had allowed him to work four days a week, he did not want to go back to working five days a week. In 2020, he filed a grievance over this. Two days before the arbitration hearing, to resolve the grievance, the parties signed a letter of agreement stating that the Claimant would voluntarily leave his job by December 31, 2022. The General Division found that the evidence did not support the Claimant\u2019s position that he had signed the agreement because his employer had threatened and bullied him at work.\n[12] The General Division found that the Claimant had reasonable alternatives to leaving his job. He could have agreed to work five days a week pending the outcome of his grievance. He could have looked for another, more suitable job while still working.\n[13] The issue before the General Division was whether the Claimant had just cause under section 29 of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) for voluntarily leaving his job.\n[14] Whether you had just cause for voluntarily leaving a job depends on whether, considering all the circumstances, you had no reasonable alternative to leaving.\n[15] Despite the many circumstances described in section 29(c) of the EI Act that would amount to just cause for voluntarily leaving a job, the primary question remains the same: Did the claimant have reasonable alternatives to leaving?\n[16] The evidence shows that the Claimant had the following options: proceed with the arbitration hearing or choose to sign the departure agreement proposed by his employer. His union met with the employer and, after discussion between all the parties, the Claimant chose the second option.\n[17] The agreement says that the Claimant agreed to leave his job with the employer by December 31, 2022.Footnote 2 The parties acknowledged that the contents of the agreement accurately reflected what they had agreed on, and they declared that they had signed the agreement freely and after due consideration.Footnote 3\n[18] I am of the view that the General Division did not make any reviewable errors when it concluded from the evidence that the Claimant voluntarily left his job and that leaving was not his only reasonable option. He could have agreed to work five days a week to keep his job, at least until a decision was made by the arbitration board. He also could have continued his job search to find a more suitable job.Footnote 4\n[19] The Claimant made the decision with his union to leave his job on December 31, 2022. He chose not to proceed before the arbitration board. As the General Division noted, the evidence does not support that the employer forced the Claimant to sign the departure agreement.\n[20] In my view, the General Division correctly stated the legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and looked at whether, after considering all of the circumstances, the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job. It is important to remember that the primary purpose of the EI Act is to compensate claimants who have lost their jobs involuntarily.\n[21] An appeal to the Appeal Division is not an opportunity for the Claimant to present his case again and hope for a different outcome. I find that the Claimant has not raised any question of fact, law, or jurisdiction that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\n[22] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [23] Permission to appeal is not granted. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee the Claimant\u2019s full arguments at AD1-1 to AD1-54.\nFootnote 2\nSee the letter of agreement and settlement and release for grievance 2020-01 at clause 2.\nFootnote 3\nSee the letter of agreement and settlement and release for grievance 2020-01 at clause 10.\nFootnote 4\nSee Stavropoulos v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 109. The Court found that the claimant had a choice, since he could have gone through the arbitration process to challenge the measures taken by his employer rather than choosing to leave his job.\n",

Over time, he developed severe back pain that prevented him from repetitive bending and lifting, as well as from extended sitting or standing. Eventually, imaging showed multiple disc herniations in his spine. X let him go in August 2010.\n[3] The Appellant went on to earn a real estate broker\u2019s license, but he says he was never able to earn a living in that field because of his impairment. In June 2022, he applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension. The Minister of Employment and Social Development refused the application after determining that the Appellant did not have a severe and prolonged disability before the end of his minimum qualifying period (MQP), which ended on December 31, 2014.Footnote 1\n[4] The Appellant appealed the Minister\u2019s refusal to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s General Division. It held a hearing by teleconference and dismissed the appeal. It found that, although the Appellant was unable to perform his previous job as a forklift operator, he was still capable of non-physical employment.\n[5] The Appellant then asked the Appeal Division for permission to appeal, alleging that the General Division had made various errors in arriving at its decision. Late last year, one of my colleagues on the Appeal Division allowed the Appellant\u2019s appeal to proceed.\n[6] I held a hearing to discuss the Appellant\u2019s claim appeal in full. Midway through the hearing, the Minister\u2019s representative requested an impromptu settlement conference. At the conference, the parties reached an agreement, and they have asked me to prepare a decision that reflects that agreement.\nAgreement [7] The Minister conceded that the Appellant was disabled as of December 2014, the last date on which he had CPP disability coverage. The Minister accepted that the Appellant\u2019s chronic back pain rendered him regularly incapable of working in any substantially gainful occupation during his MQP and thereafter.Footnote 2\n[8] The Appellant expressed his agreement with these statements.\nConclusion [9] I hereby allow the appeal in accordance with the parties\u2019 agreement. Since the Minister received the Appellant\u2019s application for benefits in June 2022, the Appellant is deemed disabled as of March 2021.Footnote 3 That means the effective start date of the Appellant\u2019s CPP disability pension is July 2021.Footnote 4\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nAn MQP is established by working and contributing to the CPP. It is the period in which a contributor had coverage for the CPP disability pension.\nFootnote 2\nRefer to recording of the hearing held on February 27, 2024.\nFootnote 3\nUnder section 42(2)(b) of the Canada Pension Plan, a person cannot be deemed disabled more than 15 months before the Minister received the application for a disability pension.\nFootnote 4\nAccording to section 69 of the Canada Pension Plan, payments start four months after the deemed date of disability.\n",

The appeal will not go ahead. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] P. L. (Claimant) turned 60 years of age in June 2022. He applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension on November 29, 2022. He started receiving his retirement pension the next month, in December 2022.\n[3] In March 2023, the Claimant asked the Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) to reconsider the start date and the monthly payment amount of his retirement pension.\n[4] The Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision didn\u2019t change either start date or the calculation of the pension payment amounts.\n[5] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal. The General Division decided the following:\nThe Claimant isn\u2019t eligible to have his retirement pension start any earlier. The Minister correctly calculated the amount of the retirement pension.\nIssues [6] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error in its decision about the Claimant\u2019s start date for his CPP retirement pension? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [7] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[8] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[9] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division. [10] The Claimant argues that the General Division should have allowed his pension payments to start sooner, and so the General Division reached the wrong conclusion in his appeal. The Claimant had good reason for applying later than he planned: some paperwork in his home was misplaced due to water damage and his wife is ill.Footnote 3\n[11] There\u2019s no arguable case here that the General Division made an error, so I cannot give the Claimant permission to appeal. The Claimant has good reasons why it took him longer than he planned to apply for his retirement pension. However, the CPP is specific about when the retirement pension can start. As the General Division explained, since the Claimant applied for the pension before he turned 65, the payments start on whichever date is the latest from the following:\nThe month the Claimant turned 60 The month after the Minister received the application The month the Claimant chose in the applicationFootnote 4\n[12] In the Claimant\u2019s case, the latest date is December 2022 (the month after the Minister received the Claimant\u2019s application).Footnote 5 The Tribunal has no discretion to change the date the Claimant\u2019s pension starts, despite the reasons the Claimant gave for the Minister receiving his application later than he planned. As a result, I cannot conclude that the General Division may have made an error here in its decision about the start date for the Claimant\u2019s retirement pension.\n[13] The General Division had to follow the CPP. Following the law in this case led the General Division to conclude that the Claimant\u2019s pension starts the month after the Minister received the application. I see no possible error with the General Division\u2019s analysis.\n[14] The Tribunal doesn\u2019t have the discretion to select a different date based on the information the Claimant provided. The Tribunal also cannot increase the monthly payments based on the financial needs of the Claimant.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that wasn\u2019t provided to the General Division. [15] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that wasn\u2019t provided to the General Division, so I cannot grant permission to appeal on that basis either.\n[16] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence.Footnote 6\nConclusion [17] I\u2019ve refused the Claimant permission to appeal.

L.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated December 21, 2023 (GE-23-3125)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: February 29, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-42\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) applied for Employment Insurance benefits on March 23, 2020. A benefit period for the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB) was established. On April 6, 2020, the Respondent (Commission) made an advance payment of $2,000 to the Claimant.\n[3] The Commission is now asking the Claimant to pay back the $2,000. The Commission says that the Claimant received eight weeks of the EI ERB while he was unemployed for four weeks. This means that he has to pay back the $2,000 benefit overpayment.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant received four weeks of the EI ERB at the rate of $500 for a total of $2,000 for the period from March 22, 2020, to April 18, 2020. It found that the Claimant received a total of $4,000. This resulted in a $2,000 overpayment. The General Division found that he had to pay back the $2,000 to the Commission.\n[5] The Claimant is asking the Appeal Division for permission to appeal the General Division decision. He argues that he should not be penalized for promptly returning to work. He says that he is not responsible for the overlapping of two regimes and that the Commission must take responsibility for its poor management.\n[6] I have to decide whether there is an arguable case that the General Division made a reviewable error based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\n[7] I am refusing permission to appeal because the Claimant has not raised a ground of appeal based on which the appeal has a reasonable chance of success.\nIssue [8] Does the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made?\nAnalysis [9] Section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[10] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he must show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[11] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nDoes the Claimant\u2019s appeal have a reasonable chance of success based on a reviewable error the General Division may have made? [12] The Claimant argues that he should not be penalized for promptly returning to work. He says that he is not responsible for the overlapping of two regimes and that the Commission must take responsibility for its poor management.\n[13] The General Division found that the Claimant received four weeks of the EI ERB at the rate of $500 for a total of $2,000 for the period from March 22, 2020, to April 18, 2020. It found that the Claimant received a total of $4,000. This resulted in a $2,000 overpayment. The General Division found that he had to pay back the $2,000 to the Commission.\n[14] I note that the legislation in force during the pandemic allowed the Commission to reconsider whether a person received an amount of EI ERB that they were not eligible for. The law is clear that the Claimant has to pay back the overpayment.Footnote 1\n[15] In addition, Federal Court of Appeal case law clearly states that an amount received by a claimant without entitlement, even after a Commission error, does not excuse the claimant from having to repay it.Footnote 2\n[16] So, the General Division made no reviewable error when it found that the Claimant had to pay back the EI ERB overpayment.\n[17] Unfortunately, the law does not allow for any discrepancies and does not give any discretion to the Tribunal to write off the overpayment. As the General Division noted, the law gives the Commission exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether to forgive a debt owed to it under the law.Footnote 3\n[18] For the above reasons, and after reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the Claimant\u2019s arguments in support of his application for permission to appeal, I find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. The Claimant has not raised any issue that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\nConclusion [19] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 44, 52, and 153.6(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 2\nLanuzo v Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 324.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 56 of the Employment Insurance Regulations.\n",

The law does not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020.\nOverview [2] The Appellant (Claimant) made a claim for benefits on April 14, 2020. A benefit period for the Employment Insurance (EI) Emergency Response Benefit (ERB) was established effective March 29, 2020. However, the Claimant did not submit her claimant reports. On April 4, 2022, she asked the Respondent (Commission) to treat her claim as though she had been submitting her claimant reports since March 29, 2020. She made a request to antedate her claim.\n[3] The Commission decided that the Claimant had not established good cause for the delay in making her claim for the period from March 29, 2020, to April 4, 2022. The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider, but it upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the law did not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020. It found that the Claimant qualified on September 27, 2020, and had shown that she had good cause for the delay at that time. The General Division decided that the Claimant\u2019s claim could only be antedated to September 27, 2020.\n[5] The Claimant was given permission to appeal the General Division decision. She argues that the General Division made an error because she never asked to antedate her claim to September 27, 2020. She asked for an antedate to March 29, 2020.\n[6] I have to decide whether the General Division made an error of law when it decided that the law did not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020.\n[7] I am dismissing the Claimant\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [8] Did the General Division make an error of law when it decided that the law did not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [9] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[10] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[11] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal.\nDid the General Division make an error of law when it decided that the law did not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020? [12] The Claimant made an initial claim for benefits on April 14, 2020, and a benefit period for the EI ERB was established effective March 29, 2020. Although a benefit period was established, the Claimant did not submit any claimant reports.\n[13] On April 4, 2022, the Claimant asked the Commission to treat her claim as though she had been submitting her claimant reports since March 29, 2020. She made a request to antedate her claim.\n[14] At the General Division hearing, the Claimant explained that it was only after several treatments and tests that she was diagnosed with a chronic illness. During that period, she took medication prescribed to her by her doctor, but it was not suitable because she was still in pain and experienced many side effects. She mentioned experiencing side effects that were very rare when taking this medication.\n[15] The Claimant also explained that she was completely confused and that her memory was affected. Despite taking this medication, she still had symptoms and had to be weaned off before her doctor could direct her to an alternative. She said that she also experienced side effects during withdrawal and that she had surgery afterwards.\n[16] A medical certificate dated November 3, 2022, and signed by her doctor indicates that the Claimant failed to complete the EI process because of the \u201cheavy medication\u201d she had to take during that period, which made her drowsy. The doctor wrote that this failure was \u201creally\u201d due to the effects of the medication.\n[17] The General Division accepted the Claimant\u2019s explanations for the delay in submitting her claimant reports because there were exceptional circumstances that prevented her from submitting them on time.\n[18] The General Division considered that section 153.8(2) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) says that a claim for the EI ERB must not be made after December 2, 2020. The General Division found that the Claimant did not qualify for the EI ERB because it was too late to claim it when she made her claim for benefits on April 4, 2022.\n[19] However, the General Division found that the Claimant could get her claim antedated to September 27, 2020, when the EI ERB period set by Parliament ended.Footnote 2\n[20] Section 10(5) of the EI Act says that a claim for benefits, other than an initial claim for benefits, made after the time prescribed for making the claim will be regarded as having been made on an earlier day if the claimant shows that there was good cause for the delay throughout the period beginning on the earlier day and ending on the day when the claim was made.\n[21] It is true that the purpose of section 10(5) of the EI Act is to allow a late claim to be treated as though it was made on time if the claimant had good cause for the delay.Footnote 3\n[22] However, when the Claimant made her claim for benefits, temporary measures were in place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A claimant who made a claim for benefits during that period got the EI ERB instead.Footnote 4\n[23] Unfortunately for the Claimant, section 10(5) of the EI Act falls under Part I of the EI Act. Parliament has specifically provided that this provision does not apply to EI ERB claims.Footnote 5\n[24] I can only note that the law does not permit the Tribunal to allow the Claimant an antedate for the period before September 27, 2020.\n[25] I have great sympathy for the Claimant, who seems to be in a situation that Parliament did not anticipate when the temporary pandemic measures were introduced. However, I do not have the authority to change the law so that her claim can be antedated to March 29, 2020.\n[26] I have no choice but to find that the General Division did not make an error of law when it decided that the law did not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020.\nConclusion [27] The appeal is dismissed. The law does not allow the Claimant\u2019s claim to be antedated to March 29, 2020.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; and Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nIf you had not received the EI ERB, you could claim EI regular benefits from September 27, 2020.\nFootnote 3\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Piche, A-248-80.\nFootnote 4\nThe law says that for the period beginning on March 15, 2020, and ending on September 26, 2020, no benefit period is to be established for EI benefits under Part I.

A.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nRepresentative:\nAdded Party: S. A.\nRepresentative:\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated September 11, 2023 (GP-23-433)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: January 5, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-1094\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] W. A. (Claimant) is 60 years of age. He married the Added Party on December 31, 2012. They separated on November 2, 2020. Their divorce took effect on May 13, 2022. All these events took place in Manitoba, where both the Added Party and the Claimant still live.\n[3] The Added Party applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) credit split on May 25, 2022. She sought the equal division of the CPP contributions she and the Claimant made during their marriage and up to their separation. The Minister granted the application and upheld it on reconsideration. The Claimant opposed the credit split and appealed. The General Division dismissed the appeal, finding that the CPP credit split was performed according to the law. None of the possible exceptions to the mandatory credit split applied.\nIssues [4] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Could the General Division have made an error that would justify granting the Claimant permission to appeal? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [5] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; made an error applying the facts to the law.Footnote 1\n[6] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[7] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division [8] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an argument that would justify giving him permission to appeal.\n[9] The Claimant argues that the credit split is unfair because he has heath concerns, and he has been more than financially supportive of the Added Party.\n[10] At the General Division, the Claimant was not able to show that the Minister incorrectly applied the CPP credit split. As the General Division decision explains, the credit split is mandatory once the Minister receives the information required by the CPP regulations.Footnote 3\n[11] The decision also explains that the split cannot take place if it reduces the CPP entitlement for both spouses, or in some cases where there is a court order to prevent the credit split, or an agreement to avoid the credit split. The General Division found no evidence that splitting the credits reduced the Added Party\u2019s entitlement, and there was no court order or agreement before the General Division to avoid the credit split either.\n[12] The Claimant has reasons why he would prefer not to split the pension credits, but they cannot form the basis for giving him permission to appeal the General Division\u2019s decision. The General Division applied the law about credit splitting to the facts of the Claimant\u2019s situation. The outcome is not what the Claimant wanted, but he hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for a possible error by the General Division.\nThere\u2019s no new evidence at the Appeal Division that would form the basis for giving permission to appeal [13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that the General Division didn\u2019t have. Accordingly, there is no new evidence that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal.\n[14] I\u2019ve reviewed the record and I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence about splitting the pension credits in this appeal.Footnote 4\nConclusion [15] I\u2019ve refused the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal won\u2019t go ahead to the next step.\nNote de bas pages\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 58.1(a) and (b) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision, which references section 55.1(1)(a) of the Canada Pension Plan and section 54(2) of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations.\nFootnote 4\nFor more on the need for this kind of review, see Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

P.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (604447) dated September 20, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Manon Sauv\u00e9\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 4, 2024\nHearing participants: Appellant Appellant\u2019s partner\nDecision date: January 10, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-2863\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed. The Appellant didn\u2019t make false statements within the meaning of the Act.Footnote 1 This means that a penalty should not be imposed.\nOverview [2] For several years, the Appellant owned a denture clinic. The staff consisted of four denturists and an administrative assistant.\n[3] On September 18, 2021, the clinic\u2019s administrative assistant went on maternity leave. She was scheduled to go back to work around October 2022.\n[4] Meanwhile, the Appellant\u2019s partner and a friend split the hours. In the fall of 2022, the administrative assistant told the Appellant that she would not be going back to work.\n[5] The Appellant posted the job as a full-time job. In November 2022, he hired a new administrative assistant. He terminated the employment of his partner and of her friend.\n[6] They went to a Service Canada Centre to find out about whether they could apply for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. They understood that they aren\u2019t entitled to benefits because they no longer want to work full-time. One is 77 years old and the other is 67 years old. They are both retired. They helped the Appellant while the administrative assistant was on maternity leave.\n[7] The Commission started an investigation. It seemed to suspect that the jobs didn\u2019t exist.\n[8] After the Commission gathered information from the Appellant, the two employees, and the Appellant\u2019s accounting department, it concluded that the Appellant had made false statements. It imposed a penalty of $8,000.\n[9] The Appellant asked for a reconsideration. He says that he didn\u2019t make false statements. There was an end to the contract for the two employees who didn\u2019t want to work full-time. This was temporary work until the administrative assistant would come back from maternity leave.\n[10] On reconsideration, the Commission upheld its decision about the false statements but reduced the penalty to $3,200.\nIssues\nDid the Appellant make two false statements? If so, did the Commission use its discretion by imposing a penalty of $3,200 on the Appellant?\nIssue 1: Did the Appellant make two false statements? [11] When the Commission says that a person made a false representation they knew was misleading, it has to prove that.Footnote 2 It has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means it has to be more likely that the person made a false statement.\n[12] The Commission has to show that the person wrongly answered a very simple question.Footnote 3 If it shows this, the burden of proof is reversed. It is now up to the individual to provide a reasonable explanation for why the false statement wasn\u2019t made wilfully.\n[13] To interpret the word \u201cknew,\u201d a subjective test should be used to determine whether the required knowledge exists. \u201cIt is not sufficient to proclaim one\u2019s ignorance to avoid sanctions; it is permissible to consider common sense and objective factors to decide whether a claimant had subjective knowledge of the falsity of his or her representations.\u201dFootnote 4\n[14] In this case, I note that the Appellant owned a denture clinic for several years. An administrative assistant managed the clinic to assist four denturists.\n[15] In 2021, the administrative assistant stopped working because of maternity leave. Faced with the difficulties of recruiting a replacement during the pandemic, the Appellant\u2019s partner and a friend split the work during the assistant\u2019s maternity leave. They were to stop working when she went back.\n[16] The assistant told the Appellant that she was leaving her job. This means she would not be going back to work after her maternity leave. So, the Appellant had to hire a new assistant. He agreed with his partner and a friend that the contract would end when the assistant would go back, but because of her resignation, it would be when the new assistant was hired.\n[17] The new assistant was finally hired in November 2022. The Appellant\u2019s partner stopped working. The friend finished a few weeks later, to train the new assistant. They have always been clear about not wanting to work full-time. They are 77 and 67 years old, respectively.\n[18] A request was sent to the clinic\u2019s accountant asking him to issue two separations. On the Record of Employment (ROE), it says shortage of work\/end of contract. The Appellant\u2019s partner and her friend asked the Commission whether they could receive EI benefits.\n[19] The accountant who was running the business of the clinic left his job. He was replaced by a new accountant. She completed the ROEs indicating shortage of work\/end of contract.\n[20] On January 9, 2023, the Commission contacted the accountant who completed the ROEs. She told it that she started working on November 8, 2022. She doesn\u2019t know all the details. She confirmed that the Appellant\u2019s partner and a friend worked in 2022. Also, there was an error on one employee\u2019s ROE. She had to correct it.\n[21] On January 9, 2023, the Commission contacted the Appellant\u2019s partner for information about her job\u2014how many hours, what her tasks were, etc.\n[22] Also on January 9, 2023, the Commission tried to reach the Appellant but was unsuccessful.\n[23] On January 10, 2023, the Commission contacted the partner\u2019s friend. It asked about the relationship between the friend, the Appellant, and his partner. It asked her about her work duties, whether she pays them when she stays with them.\n[24] I note that the Commission\u2019s questions are to determine whether the friend is a related person. And whether the positions actually existed.\n[25] On January 10, 2023, it contacted the Appellant\u2019s partner again. The questions were mainly about how the clinic operates and the Appellant\u2019s tasks.\n[26] On January 10, 2023, the Commission contacted the new accountant again. It asked her whether the Appellant\u2019s partner had worked in 2021. It wanted information about the business.\n[27] On January 10, 2023, the Commission contacted the Appellant\u2019s partner once again. This time, it decided to send the Canada Revenue Agency the file of the business to determine whether the hours worked by the Appellant\u2019s partner and her friend were insurable hours.\n[28] On January 11, 2023, the Commission contacted the partner\u2019s friend. It told her that her hours of work were certainly insurable, but she wasn\u2019t entitled because she wasn\u2019t available for full-time work.\n[29] On January 12, 2023, the Commission asked the new accountant for the paycheques. It asked her to send at least one cheque she had issued for a supplier.\n[30] From the Commission\u2019s many requests, I understand that it wanted to determine whether the business existed and whether the people actually worked there. It wasn\u2019t looking at the reason for the termination of employment of the Appellant\u2019s partner and her friend yet.\n[31] I understand that the Commission will continue its communications with the Appellant, the Appellant\u2019s partner, and the friend.\n[32] On January 23, 2023, the Commission contacted the new accountant. It insisted on obtaining documents. The new accountant said that she wasn\u2019t authorized to forward the documents.\n[33] On January 25, 2023, the Commission reached the Appellant. The questions were to determine the role of each individual in the business. It also wanted company documents.\n[34] This led to discussions between the Commission and the new accountant, the Appellant\u2019s partner, the Appellant, and the partner\u2019s friend.\n[35] After reading the information gathered by the Commission, I still don\u2019t know what the objectives were. Was it to show that this is a fictitious business, that they are fictitious workers, or the involvement of the four individuals in the business? The process could be called a fishing expedition. This is because the notes say that the individuals don\u2019t really know why all these questions were asked.\n[36] The Commission says that the Appellant knew that these were false statements, since he asked it to reconsider the penalty for making false statements.\n[37] I understand the Commission\u2019s position. But I don\u2019t fully agree with its interpretation. After several conversations over the phone between January and February, where there was no mention of false statements on the ROE, the Commission issued a decision on June 12, 2023, about false statements. I will come back to that.\n[38] On February 13, 2023, as part of its investigation, the Commission asked the accountant whether she had been asked to indicate a shortage of work. The Commission\u2019s notes say that she replied, [translation] \u201cShe had a note on her desk saying that the employer had called and that she had to complete the ROEs for an end of contract.\u201dFootnote 5\n[39] The notes also say that the new accountant repeatedly said that she didn\u2019t know because she was new. She thought some things but wasn\u2019t sure.\n[40] And this is where the Commission\u2019s investigation takes a turn. It argues that the Appellant made false statements, because he indicated \u201cshortage of work\/end of contract,\u201d when there was still work, since he hired a new person full-time.\n[41] On April 3, 2023, the Commission spoke with the new accountant, and she reiterated that, from memory, it was an end of contract.Footnote 6 Again, the new accountant doesn\u2019t really know what happened.\n[42] On June 12, 2023, the Commission imposed a penalty of $8,000 on the Appellant for making false statements.\n[43] The Commission says that the Appellant gave false information on the ROE. He knew that the employees would be replaced by a full-time employee. He wanted to allow both employees to receive EI benefits.\n[44] The Commission upheld its decision on the Appellant\u2019s request about false statements. But it reduced the penalty to $3,200.\n[45] In this appeal, the Commission argues that it is the presence of conflicting versions of the facts that must be decided by accepting the evidence that is reasonable, reliable, and credible in the circumstances. The Commission considered the parties\u2019 versions not credible and contradictory.\n[46] It referred to its request to get the statement from a personal or business bank account. The Appellant refused to send the cheques to the Commission. His partner said that she didn\u2019t know anything about paperwork.\n[47] In its submissions, the Commission also argues that the Appellant made false statements because he indicated a shortage of work on the ROEs.Footnote 7\n[48] Yet, the Commission says that the accountant clarified that this was an end of contract.Footnote 8\n[49] The Appellant reiterates that he had an agreement with his 77\u2011year\u2011old partner and her 67-year-old friend to replace the administrative assistant on maternity leave. Their contract would end when she would go back.\n[50] The evidence shows that she quit her job. The partner stopped working in November 2022, when the new assistant was hired. Her friend stayed until January 2023 to help the new assistant. In the meantime, the clinic was sold to the Appellant\u2019s daughter.\n[51] After considering the evidence on file, and the parties\u2019 testimony and submissions, I am of the view that the Commission hasn\u2019t shown that the Appellant made false statements.\n[52] The Appellant has always said that he had an agreement with his partner and a friend to work at the clinic. They split the work during the administrative assistant\u2019s maternity leave. They were to stop working when she went back. They never intended to work full-time. They are 77 and 67 years old.\n[53] Their work ended when the new assistant was hired. This is the agreement that the parties had from the beginning. The Appellant asked that the ROE show an end of contract. For him, this was an end of contract, since they had been hired part-time during the replacement.\n[54] In fact, the new accountant told the Commission from the beginning that the Appellant had asked to indicate end of contract. She entered shortage of work\/end of contract. In my view, I cannot find that false statements were made because the new accountant gave two reasons. In fact, she followed the Commission\u2019s rules for end of contracts where A has to be entered in Block 16.\n[55] So, that isn\u2019t enough to find that the Appellant made false statements, because the new accountant indicated both reasons in Block A [sic]. The reason for the termination is simple, but the answer isn\u2019t wrong like the Commission says it is. There was an end to the contract between the parties.\n[56] It was entirely reasonable for the partner and the friend to apply for EI benefits. The Commission decides whether they meet the criteria. Clearly, it decided that they didn\u2019t meet the requirements of the Act because they weren\u2019t available for full-time work.Footnote 9\n[57] I am not persuaded about the contradictions that the Commission raised to show that the individuals involved aren\u2019t credible. They received several calls from the Commission in a short period of time. Those who provided the information are retired seniors and a new accountant, and did so to the best of their knowledge. Each person was consistent with their version of the facts. And just because the Appellant told the Commission that he refused to forward the documents and because his partner claims that she doesn\u2019t know anything about documents doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t credible and that the statements are false. Even though they gave different information, this isn\u2019t enough to show that false statements were made.\n[58] The Appellant, his partner, her friend, and the new accountant are credible when they say that this was an end of contract. They aren\u2019t false statements.\n[59] As a result, I disagree with the Commission that the Appellant made false statements.\nIssue 2: If so, did the Commission use its discretion properly by imposing a penalty of $3,200 on the Appellant? [60] Since I have found that the Appellant didn\u2019t make false statements, there is no need to impose a penalty on him. So, I don\u2019t have to consider whether the Commission used its discretion properly.\nConclusion [61] The Commission hasn\u2019t shown that the Appellant made false statements. This means that a penalty should not be imposed.\n[62] The appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSection 39 of the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee Canada v Bellil, 2017 FCA 104.\nFootnote 3\nSee Bellil, 2017 FCA 104 at para 15; Purcell A-694-94; and Gates A-600-94.\nFootnote 4\nCanada v Bellil, 2017 FCA 104.\nFootnote 5\nGD3-28.\nFootnote 6\nGD3-29.\nFootnote 7\nGD4-4 para 6.\nFootnote 8\nGD4-4 para 5.\nFootnote 9\nI won\u2019t comment on the Commission\u2019s statement about the definition of availability under the Act.\n",

M.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (614431) dated August 23, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Manon Sauv\u00e9\nType of hearing: In person\nHearing date: January 15, 2024\nHearing participant: Appellant\nDecision date: January 29, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-2663\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The Appellant has shown that he had good cause for the delay in applying for benefits.Footnote 1 Good cause is a reason the law accepts for the delay. This means that his application can be treated as though it was made earlier.\nOverview [3] The Appellant works as a brush cutter in forestry. He has to travel long distances in the regions.\n[4] He finished his job on September 24, 2022. He returned to his hometown around September 25, 2022.\n[5] He applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits on November 1, 2022. He is now asking the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) to treat his application as though it was made earlier, on September 25, 2022.\n[6] The Appellant\u2019s reason for the delay in applying is that he tried several times to reach an agent at Service Canada. He could not get around with his vehicle that needed to be repaired. He had no problem applying over the phone during the pandemic.\n[7] The Commission refused the Appellant\u2019s request to have his application antedated to September 25, 2022. The Commission says that the Appellant doesn\u2019t have good cause for the delay.\n[8] The Appellant disagrees with the Commission. He tried to get information from the Commission but was unsuccessful.\nIssue [9] Can the Appellant\u2019s application for benefits be treated as though it was made on September 25, 2022? This is called antedating (or, backdating) the application.\nAnalysis [10] To get your application for benefits antedated, you have to prove these two things:Footnote 2\na) You had good cause for the delay during the entire period of the delay. In other words, you have an explanation that the law accepts. b) You qualified for benefits on the earlier day (that is, the day you want your application antedated to).\n[11] The main arguments in this case are about whether the Appellant had good cause. So, that is where I will start.\n[12] To show good cause, the Appellant has to prove that he acted as a reasonable and prudent person would have acted in similar circumstances.Footnote 3 In other words, he has to show that he acted reasonably and carefully just as anyone else would have if they were in a similar situation.\n[13] The Appellant has to show that he acted this way for the entire period of the delay.Footnote 4 That period is from the day he wants his application antedated to until the day he actually applied. So, for the Appellant, the period of the delay is from September 25, 2022, to November 1, 2022.\n[14] The Appellant also has to show that he took reasonably prompt steps to understand his entitlement to benefits and obligations under the law.Footnote 5 This means that the Appellant has to show that he tried to learn about his rights and responsibilities as soon as possible and as best he could. If the Appellant didn\u2019t take these steps, then he must show that there were exceptional circumstances that explain why he didn\u2019t do so.Footnote 6\n[15] The Appellant has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that he has to show that it is more likely than not that he had good cause for the delay.\n[16] I understand that the Appellant works as a brush cutter in the north. In 2022, he returned around September 24. He was stopped by police because of the condition of his vehicle. He got several tickets that required him to do repairs on his vehicle. He could not afford to pay more than $10,000.\n[17] He made efforts to buy a new car. He also tried to apply for EI benefits over the phone. But there was a bug. He could not get to the Service Canada office. He tried to reach an agent by phone but was unsuccessful.\n[18] He went to the Service Canada office around November 1, 2022. He had a vehicle to get to the office. He applied and asked that his application be effective from September 25, 2022.\n[19] Also, during the pandemic, he didn\u2019t have problems applying over the phone. He doesn\u2019t understand why the situation has changed.\n[20] The Commission says that the Appellant didn\u2019t act like a reasonable person in the circumstances. He hasn\u2019t proven that he tried to contact the Commission. He applied to have his application effective only on November 1, 2022. The Commission was unable to reach the Appellant during the reconsideration request. It argues that the Appellant should have promptly learned about his rights.\n[21] After reviewing the record, hearing the Appellant, and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, I find that the Appellant had good cause for the delay.\n[22] I find that the Appellant lives and works in isolated locations. He can only rely on himself to meet his needs and get information from the Commission. When he lost access to a vehicle, he could not travel to get information at the Service Canada office. He tried to call but was unsuccessful. He also tried to complete his application over the phone.\n[23] At the hearing, the Appellant explained his situation and the efforts he made to complete his application for benefits. As soon as he had access to a vehicle, he made efforts.\n[24] In addition, the Commission has an administrative policy in place to process antedate requests.Footnote 7 The Appellant stopped working on September 24, 2022. He asks that benefits start on the Sunday of the week of interruption of earnings. In his case, he asked for benefits to start on September 25, 2022.\n[25] The Commission\u2019s policy says that you must apply within four calendar weeks. In the Appellant\u2019s case, the week starts with the interruption of earnings on September 25, 2022. So, he could apply until October 23, 2022, without having to explain why he was late. The Appellant applied in the fifth week. The Commission decided that benefits would start on that date.Footnote 8\n[26] I find that the Appellant had good cause for the delay in applying for benefits, given the Commission\u2019s policy. I understand that the Appellant acted as quickly as possible when he had access to a vehicle. As I mentioned, the Appellant lives in the regions, he lives alone, and he doesn\u2019t have access to public transit.\n[27] Regarding the question of whether the Appellant qualified at the time of his application, I understand that the Appellant answered it. The Commission refused to pay benefits from September 25, 2022, solely because the Appellant had applied late without good cause.\nConclusion [28] The Appellant has proven that he had good cause for the delay in applying for benefits throughout the entire period of the delay.\n[29] The appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSection 10(4) of the Employment Insurance Act (Act) uses the term \u201cinitial claim\u201d when talking about a claimant\u2019s first application for benefits, which is used to determine whether the claimant qualifies to establish a benefit period.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 10(4) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Burke, 2012 FCA 139.\nFootnote 4\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Burke, 2012 FCA 139.\nFootnote 5\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Somwaru, 2010 FCA 336; and Canada (Attorney General) v Kaler, 2011 FCA 266.\nFootnote 6\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Somwaru, 2010 FCA 336; and Canada (Attorney General) v Kaler, 2011 FCA 266.\nFootnote 7\nSee Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles \u2013 Chapter 3 \u2013 Section 1.\nFootnote 8\nSee GD3-18.\n",

This means that the Appellant isn\u2019t disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.Footnote 1\nOverview [3] The Appellant worked as a financial security advisor for an insurance broker from June 2022. She was let go on July 25, 2023.\n[4] The Appellant applied for EI regular benefits. The Commission investigated the Appellant and the employer to find out the reasons for the dismissal. The employer says it received three complaints about the Appellant. Because of this, on July 25, 2013, the employer met with the Appellant and let her go. The Commission is refusing to pay the Appellant benefits because she lost her job because of misconduct.\n[5] The Appellant disagrees with the Commission\u2019s decision. The employer didn\u2019t provide evidence of the complaints. It said it was confidential. The Appellant argues that she was let go for no reason. She filed a complaint with the Commission de normes, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la sant\u00e9 du travail [sic] [Quebec\u2019s labour standards commission] (CNESST) because she considers that the dismissal was illegal and that she didn\u2019t commit the alleged acts.\nMatter I have to consider first [6] At the hearing, the Appellant\u2019s representative submitted additional documents. The Appellant also sent in documents after the hearing, including the agreement between the Appellant and her employer before the CNESST.\n[7] As I mentioned at the hearing, the documents were sent to the Commission so it could make additional submissions. I gave the Commission a deadline.Footnote 2 It didn\u2019t follow up on the letter. This means that the decision can be made after that deadline.\nIssue [8] Did the Appellant lose her job because of misconduct?\nAnalysis [9] To answer the question of whether the Appellant lost her job because of misconduct, I have to decide two things. First, I have to determine why the Appellant lost her job. Then, I have to determine whether the law considers that reason to be misconduct.\nWhy did the Appellant lose her job?Footnote 3 [10] The Appellant worked as a financial advisor for an insurance broker. She got a leave of absence from February 11, 2023, to February 27, 2023, to visit her family. She left Canada for Algeria during that period.\n[11] On February 27, 2023, she had to see a doctor urgently because she was hemorrhaging. She had to receive care in Algeria. She told her employer about the situation. She got permission from her doctor to return to Canada around July 20, 2023. She returned to Canada on July 20, 2023. She had to go back to work on July 27, 2023.\n[12] On July 24, 2023, her employer asked to meet with her by videoconference on July 25, 2023. The Appellant assumed that she needed to be aware of certain changes during her absence.\n[13] At the July 25, 2023, meeting, the employer had a representative of one of its clients with it. They told the Appellant that she was let go because she had received three complaints from an insurer, an advisor, and a client.\n[14] The Appellant asked for details about these complaints. The employer told her that everything was under investigation and confidential. The Appellant was asked to sign a release to end the employment. The Appellant refused.\n[15] According to the information the Commission obtained from the employer, the Appellant didn\u2019t comply with the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers [Financial Markets Authority] (AMF) Code of Ethics.\n[16] As part of the reconsideration request, the employer confirmed that it had received three complaints. But it said the insurer\u2019s complaint wasn\u2019t important. The Appellant was criticized for having illegible writing. The complaint from an insurance broker concerned the sale of insurance. The Appellant should have asked for the insurance to be cancelled. Instead, she asked the client to do so. Finally, the complaint from a client concerned incorrect information entered by the Appellant.\n[17] The Appellant disagrees. As a financial advisor, she has to comply with the AMF Code of Ethics. She hasn\u2019t had any complaints about her alleged acts.\n[18] She argues that the employer let her go because of her medical issues and her age.\n[19] It is likely that she made errors when entering data, but the employer hasn\u2019t proven the alleged acts.\n[20] After reviewing the file, hearing the Appellant\u2019s testimony, and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, I am of the view that the Commission hasn\u2019t proven the Appellant\u2019s alleged acts.\n[21] A finding of misconduct must be made on the basis of clear evidence and not merely of speculation and suppositions.Footnote 4\n[22] In addition, misconduct is a violation of the law, a regulation, or an ethical rule, and may mean that an essential condition of the employment ceases to be met, resulting in dismissal.Footnote 5 We have to look at the facts. We can\u2019t simply adopt the employer\u2019s finding of misconduct. An objective assessment is needed to say that misconduct was in fact the cause of the loss of employment.Footnote 6\n[23] But the Commission hasn\u2019t proven that the Appellant breached a rule, law, or regulation. The employer argued that the Appellant didn\u2019t follow rules, without providing evidence to the Commission. It simply stated errors the Appellant had made, but there was nothing to support its accusations. Letting a person go because of misconduct is a serious matter with significant consequences. It isn\u2019t enough to agree with the employer when it didn\u2019t provide clear evidence.\n[24] The Appellant provided the agreement between her and her former employer following the employer\u2019s complaint about an illegal practice.\n[25] I understand that I am not bound by the agreement between the employer and the Appellant.Footnote 7 I still have to look at the evidence. I did consider the Commission\u2019s evidence and found that it hadn\u2019t proven the Appellant\u2019s alleged acts.\n[26] Also, although the parties didn\u2019t admit it, the employer or its business partner still signed a letter saying the Appellant had terminated her employment for personal reasons. According to the confirmation of employment, the Appellant has shown unwavering attendance, interpersonal skills, and a willingness to serve clients well.Footnote 8\n[27] This letter from the employer is difficult to reconcile with the position it took during the Commission\u2019s investigation.Footnote 9\n[28] In the circumstances, I find that the Commission hasn\u2019t proven the acts that led to the Appellant\u2019s dismissal.\n[29] I don\u2019t need to consider whether the Appellant\u2019s acts amount to misconduct because the Commission hasn\u2019t proven them.\nSo, did the Appellant lose her job because of misconduct?

C.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (449449) dated November 14, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Manon Sauv\u00e9\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: February 6, 2024\nHearing participant: Appellant\nDecision date: February 13, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-3589\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The Appellant doesn\u2019t have to pay back the $2,000 she received as an advance payment of the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB).\nOverview [3] The Appellant works seasonally in an outfitting business. She was supposed to go back to work on April 20, 2020. But, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the employer resumed operations on May 21, 2020.\n[4] At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new benefit called the EI ERB was created.Footnote 1 The amount paid for this benefit was $500 per week.Footnote 2 But the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided to pay four weeks of benefits in advance ($2,000) to first-time EI ERB claimants.\n[5] The Appellant applied for the EI ERB on April 30, 2020.\n[6] The Commission established a benefit period. On June 15, 2020, the Commission paid her $2,000.\n[7] The Appellant didn\u2019t complete her claims for benefits because she went back to work on May 21, 2020. She thought the $2,000 represented the four weeks of unemployment.\n[8] On November 13, 2021, the Commission asked the Appellant to pay back the $2,000. Because she hadn\u2019t completed her claims for benefits, the Commission found that the Appellant wasn\u2019t entitled to benefits.\nIssue [9] Does the Appellant have to pay back the EI ERB advance payment?\nAnalysis [10] From March 15 to October 3, 2020, claimants could apply for the EI ERB for two weeks at a time.Footnote 3 The law allowed the Commission to pay these benefits before they would normally have been paid.Footnote 4\n[11] The Appellant works for an outfitter. She was supposed to go back to work on April 20, 2020, but that date was pushed because of health measures introduced during the pandemic.\n[12] She applied for benefits. A [benefit] period was established effective April 20, 2020. The Appellant went back to work on May 21, 2020.\n[13] On June 15, 2020, the Commission paid the Appellant $2,000. This amount corresponded to four weeks of the EI ERB. The Commission planned to recover this advance by withholding four weeks of benefits later, usually weeks 13, 14, 18, and 19 of benefits claimed.\n[14] The Commission is asking the Appellant to pay back the benefits she was paid because she didn\u2019t complete her claims for each week of unemployment. The Commission told her that she had to complete her claims to be entitled to benefits. But the Appellant didn\u2019t complete her claims.\n[15] The Appellant says that she didn\u2019t know she was eligible for the EI ERB when she received her check for $2,000 in June 2020 for her four weeks of unemployment. She thought that her claim had been approved, since the Commission paid her four weeks of benefits after her period of unemployment.\n[16] After reviewing the file and considering the parties\u2019 arguments, I am of the view that the Appellant doesn\u2019t have to pay back the $2,000 the Commission says she owes. In making my finding, I considered sections 153.7(1) and 153.8(1) of the Employment Insurance Act:\n153.7 (1) An employment insurance emergency response benefit is payable to a claimant who makes a claim under section 153.8 and who is eligible for the benefit. [\u2026] (1.1) The Commission may pay the employment insurance emergency response benefit in advance of the customary time for paying it.\n153.8 (1) Any claimant may, in the form and manner established by the Minister, make a claim for the employment insurance emergency response benefit for any two-week period starting on a Sunday and falling within the period beginning on March 15, 2020 and ending on October 3, 2020.\n[17] In its fluid interpretation, the Commission argued before this Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division that it could establish the form for making Employment Insurance (EI) claims.Footnote 5\n[18] This means that the Appellant was eligible for four weeks of the EI ERB. She received four weeks of EI benefits. So, she doesn\u2019t have to pay back the $2,000.\n[19] The table below explains how benefits payable to the Appellant were calculated.\nWeek Week starting Benefits paid Income Eligible 153.9(1) - 2 weeks A Eligible 153.9(4) - 4 weeks B Weeks counter Eligible with A or B\n1 April 19, 2020 $ $ yes no\n$500\n2 April 26, 2020 $ $ yes no\n$500\n3 May 3, 2020 $ $ yes no\n$500\n4 May 10, 2020 $ $ yes no\n$500\n5 May 17, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n6 May 24, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n7 May 31, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n8 June 7, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n9 June 14, 2020 $2,000 $ no no\n$\n10 June 21, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n11 June 28, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n12 July 5, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n13 July 12, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n14 July 19, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n15 July 26, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n16 August 2, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n17 August 9, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n18 August 16, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n19 August 23, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n20 August 30, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n21 September 6, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n22 September 13, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n23 September 20, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n24 September 27, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n25 October 4, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n26 October 11, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n27 October 18, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\n28 October 25, 2020 $ $ no no\n$\nTotal paid $2,000\nEligibility Total\n$2,000\n[20] So, the Appellant wasn\u2019t overpaid the EI ERB. She doesn\u2019t have to pay back the $2,000 advance payment.\nConclusion [21] The Appellant doesn\u2019t have to pay back the $2,000 EI ERB payment she received.\n[22] This means that the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nPart VIII.4 of the Employment Insurance Act (Act) sets out the rules for the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 153.10 (1) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee sections 153.7(1) and 153.8 of the Act.\nFootnote 4\nSee section 153.7 (1.1) of the Act.\nFootnote 5\nSee GB v Employment Insurance Commission, SST AD-23-778; and LG v Employment Insurance Commission, SST AD-23-895.

G.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated January 17, 2024 (GE-23-2856)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nDecision date: March 5, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-117\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue I am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) was denied regular benefits by the Respondent (Commission) because he was not available for work. The Commission based its decision on a medical certificate from the Claimant that said he was unfit for work due to incapacity for the period from October 24, 2022, to July 2023. The Claimant disputed the Commission\u2019s decision, but the Commission upheld its decision on reconsideration. He appealed to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division.\n[3] The General Division found from the evidence that the Claimant was unable to work and available for work[sic] each day within the meaning of the law. It found that he was not available for work within the meaning of the law.\nIssue [4] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n1. The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. 2. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. 3. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. 4. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n[5] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case but must establish that his appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n[6] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant\u2019s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [7] The Claimant argues that he was unemployed for a period of six months. He went back to work in June 2023. He argues that the medical certificate is wrong and unnecessary. He has already been declared entitled to regular benefits. He was available and capable of work each day. He submitted a list containing his job search efforts during the period in dispute.\n[8] It is well established that I must consider only the evidence that was presented to the General Division in deciding this application. This is because an appeal to the Appeal Division is not a new opportunity to present evidence. The Appeal Division\u2019s powers are limited by the law.Footnote 1\n[9] The evidence shows that the Claimant received Employment Insurance regular benefits from October 24, 2022. His employer\u2019s Record of Employment indicated a shortage of work. The Claimant renewed his claim for benefits in April 2023 by submitting a medical certificate. The certificate indicated that he was unable to work for the period from October 24, 2022, to July 2023.\n[10] The Commission reassessed the file and converted the regular benefits to sickness benefits, resulting in an overpayment of $3,738.\n[11] Since the maximum number of weeks benefits can be paid under the law is 15 weeks, sickness benefits were paid retroactively from October 24, 2022, to February 6, 2023.\n[12] The Claimant\u2019s April 4, 2023, medical certificate indicated that he had not been able to work since his September 2022 hospitalization, and that he was unfit for work due to incapacity for the period from October 24, 2022, to July 2023.\n[13] Before the General Division, the Claimant was unable to explain why his doctor did not want to change his medical certificate if he was fit for work.\n[14] In addition, the Claimant initially told the Commission that he had not made a job search.Footnote 2\n[15] From the evidence, the General Division found that the Claimant was unable to work during the period in dispute and that he had not made an active job search. It found that he was not capable of and available for work each day within the meaning of the law.\n[16] In my view, the General Division correctly set out the applicable legal test for availability. It applied this test to the facts of the case and considered whether the Claimant was capable of and available for work.\n[17] An appeal to the Appeal Division is not an opportunity for the Claimant to reargue his case and hope for a different outcome. I find that the Claimant has not raised any question of law, fact, or jurisdiction that could justify setting aside the decision under review.\n[18] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\nConclusion [19] Permission to appeal is refused. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Sibbald v Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD3-34.\n",

G.\nDecision date: January 17, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-2856\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is dismissed.\nOverview [2] The Appellant is appealing to establish his entitlement to regular benefits. The Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) denied him regular benefits because he had provided a medical certificate that said he was unfit for work due to incapacity for the period from October 24, 2022, to July 2023.\nIssue [3] The Tribunal has to decide whether the Appellant was available and capable of work under section 18 of the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nAnalysis [4] Section 12(3)(c) of the Act says that the maximum number of weeks benefits can be paid in the case of an injury or illness is 15 weeks.\n[5] In this case, the Appellant received Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits from October 24, 2022. The Record of Employment from X indicated a shortage of work. The Appellant renewed his claim for benefits in April 2023 by submitting a medical certificate. The certificate indicated that the Appellant was unable to work for the period from October 24, 2022, to July 2023.\n[6] The Commission reassessed the file under section 12(3)(c) of the Act and converted regular benefits to sickness benefits, resulting in an overpayment of $3,738. Since the maximum number of weeks benefits can be paid under the Act is 15 weeks, sickness benefits were paid retroactively from October 24, 2022, to February 6, 2023.\n[7] The Appellant disagrees. At the hearing, he told the Tribunal that he has always been available for work and that he made a mistake when he completed his reports. He said that [he] didn\u2019t click the right button and [his] doctor didn\u2019t want to correct the certificate.\n[8] The Tribunal notes from the certificate provided in GD-03-33 that the Appellant was hospitalized in September and that he had been treated by his attending physician on October 24, 2022.\n[9] When asked at the hearing why his doctor didn\u2019t want to change his medical certificate to indicate his ability to return to work, the Appellant was evasive in his answers and concluded that he would not see her again.\n[10] At the hearing, the Appellant insisted that he was entitled to EI and that, regardless of the outcome, he would not pay back the overpayment of $3,738 or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit of $2,500 that he also owed.\nIssue [11] The Tribunal has to decide whether the Appellant was available and capable of work each day in accordance with section 18 of the Act and whether the Commission was legally correct to base its decision on section 12(3)(c) of the Act.\n[12] Even though you said that you were available and capable of work each day, nothing in the file indicates that you were. There is no evidence that you would have worked during the period in dispute or that you looked for work within the meaning of the Act. On the contrary, all the information on file shows that you were unable to work, qualifying you for sickness benefits.\n[13] The Tribunal agrees with the Commission that a medical certificate stating that you were capable of returning to work was necessary to reinstate regular benefits.\n[14] The Tribunal doesn\u2019t see any information on file indicating that you were actively looking or available for work and capable of doing so each day.\nConclusion [15] Considering all the information on file and the information obtained during the hearing, the appeal is dismissed.\n",

They all lost their jobs before or after they were off work or during that time. Then, they all applied for Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits. But the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) denied regular benefits to all the Claimants because it could not:\n\u00b7 extend their qualifying periods\n\u00b7 extend their benefit periods\n\u00b7 pay benefits for more than 50 weeks, the maximum allowed under the law\nThe Claimants appealed the Commission\u2019s decisions to the General Division. The Claimants argued that some sections of the Employment Insurance Act (Act) have a disproportionate impact on women, specifically the sections that prevent qualifying period or benefit period extensions and that limit the number of weeks of benefits they can get to 50. So, the Claimants wanted these sections to be found discriminatory and contrary to the right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter).\nAfter a lengthy process, the General Division:\n\u00b7 found that the Claimants had shown that the challenged sections violate the Charter right to equality\n\u00b7 found that the Commission hadn\u2019t shown that these violations are justified in a free and democratic society\n\u00b7 found the challenged sections of the Act unconstitutional\n\u00b7 instructed the government to take the necessary steps to allow the Claimants to get EI regular benefits for the loss of their employment\nThe Commission then appealed the General Division decision to the Appeal Division.\nTo establish a violation of section 15 of the Charter, the Claimants had to show that the challenged sections both:\n\u00b7 create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground, on their face or in their impact\n\u00b7 impose burdens or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage\nThe Appeal Division found that the General Division had made an error of law in its analysis of the entire context of the situation, since it hadn\u2019t considered the purpose of the EI program or its legislative context.\nThe Appeal Division also found that the limit of 50 weeks of benefits doesn\u2019t create or reinforce a stereotype that women aren\u2019t valuable assets to the labour force. It also doesn\u2019t affect the dignity of women by suggesting that their work is less worthy of recognition.\nThe Appeal Division has allowed the appeal and given the decision that the General Division should have given. It found that the Claimants hadn\u2019t established that sections 8(2), 8(5), 10(2), 10(8)(a), 10(10), and 12(6) of the Act violate the Charter right to equality. The challenged sections are constitutional. This means that the Claimants were subject to the limit of 50 weeks of benefits and weren\u2019t eligible for any more EI regular benefits. So, the Claimants weren\u2019t entitled to any more EI regular benefits.\nDecision Content\n[TRANSLATION]\nCitation: Canada Employment Insurance Commission v LC et al., 2024 SST 24\nSocial Security Tribunal of Canada Appeal Division\nDecision\nAppellant: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nRepresentative: Suzette Bernard\nRespondents: L.

The six Respondents (Claimants) aren\u2019t eligible for any more Employment Insurance (EI) regular benefits.\nOverview [2] The Claimants received parental and maternity benefits. They all lost their jobs before or after they were off work or during that time. Then, they all applied for EI regular benefits.Footnote 1\n[3] But, the Commission denied regular benefits to all the Claimants because it could not:\nextend their qualifying periods extend their benefit periods pay benefits for more than 50 weeks, the maximum allowed under the law\n[4] The Claimants appealed the Commission\u2019s decisions to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s General Division.\n[5] The Claimants argue that some sections of the Employment Insurance Act (Act) have a disproportionate impact on women, specifically the sections that prevent qualifying period or benefit period extensions and that limit the number of weeks of benefits they can get to 50.Footnote 2 More specifically, these sections make it harder or impossible for women to access a fundamental social safety net\u2014EI regular benefits\u2014when they are unemployed around the time their children are born.\n[6] So, the Claimants want these sections to be found discriminatory and contrary to the right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter).\n[7] Since the Claimants are challenging several sections that are interrelated, I sometimes refer to the overall effect of these sections as the 50-week limit.Footnote 3\n[8] After a lengthy process, the General Division:\nfound that the Claimants had shown that the challenged sections violate the Charter right to equality found that the Commission hadn\u2019t shown that these violations are justified in a free and democratic society found the challenged sections of the Act unconstitutional instructed the government to take the necessary steps to allow the Claimants to get EI regular benefits for the loss of their employment\n[9] The Commission then appealed the General Division decision to the Appeal Division. Here are my reasons for allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal.\nIssues [10] My decision deals with the following issues:\na) Did the General Division make an error of law by refusing to follow decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal? b) Did the General Division breach a principle of natural justice by joining the appeals and writing a single decision? c) In making its decision, did the General Division make errors of law in its analysis of the right to equality under section 15 of the Charter? d) If so, what is the best way to fix the General Division\u2019s error?\nAnalysis [11] I can intervene in this case if the General Division breached a principle of natural justice or made an error of law in making its decision.Footnote 4\nThe General Division didn\u2019t make an error when it found that earlier decisions aren\u2019t determinative of these appeals [12] The Commission argues that the Federal Court of Appeal already decided the constitutional issues raised in these appeals in Sollbach and Miller.Footnote 5 It also says that the General Division made an error of law by refusing to follow those decisions.\n[13] I reject this argument. The General Division didn\u2019t make an error in considering the issues raised in these appeals.\n[14] The General Division recognized that it may revisit a constitutional matter in the following situations:\nwhere a new legal issue is raised where there is a significant change in the circumstances or evidenceFootnote 6\n[15] As the General Division recognized, both situations exist in this case.\n[16] First, the Claimants here are challenging many different provisions, while Ms. Sollbach and Ms. Miller challenged only one provision. Second, since Sollbach and Miller, significant changes have been made to the Act and to the analytical framework that applies to cases involving section 15 of the Charter.Footnote 7 Third, the evidence in this case is more complete than the evidence in Sollbach and Miller, which is rather hard to identify.\n[17] Concerning the decision in Miceli-Riggins, it is based on different arguments, different evidence, and a different legislative scheme, namely the Canada Pension Plan.Footnote 8 This means that Miceli-Riggins should not be binding in this case.\nThe General Division didn\u2019t breach a principle of natural justice by joining the appeals and writing a single decision [18] The Commission criticizes the General Division for refusing to join the appeals at the beginning of the process and then joining them toward the end, giving a single decision in six appeals.Footnote 9 In the Commission\u2019s view, joining the appeals had the following consequences:\nThe General Division didn\u2019t conduct the contextual analysis required in a Charter case. It didn\u2019t assess the evidence or consider all the circumstances of each Claimant.\n[19] I reject the Commission\u2019s arguments on this issue.\n[20] While I acknowledge that the process was somewhat unusual, the Commission\u2019s complaints are about the quality of the decision, not the fairness of the process. The Commission isn\u2019t arguing, for example, that it wasn\u2019t given an opportunity to be heard, to answer the other parties\u2019 arguments, or to defend itself.\n[21] The Commission has never previously objected to joining appeals and has often consolidated its submissions into a single document.\nThe General Division made an error of law in its analysis of the right to equality under section 15 of the Charter [22] Context matters when considering Charter issues. So, I will begin my analysis with an overview of the EI program to give some idea of its complexity and to highlight some of its limits. I will also review the right to equality as defined by the courts when looking at section 15 of the Charter.\nThe EI program provides partial and temporary income support [23] The Supreme Court of Canada has previously set out the history and purpose of the Act.Footnote 10 The law creates \u201ca social insurance plan to compensate unemployed workers for loss of income from their employment and [provides] them with economic and social security for a time, thus assisting them in returning to the labour market.\u201dFootnote 11\n[24] Parliament has made many changes to the law over the years. These changes generally expanded qualifying conditions, increased benefits, and eliminated certain inequities.Footnote 12\n[25] Among these changes, Parliament increased the number of situations in which a person can have an involuntary interruption of earnings and be entitled to EI benefits.\n[26] EI special benefits provide temporary support for insured persons who are unable to work because of certain life events, including illness, pregnancy, or an obligation to care for a newborn or newly adopted child.Footnote 13\n[27] The following key aspects of the EI program are worth noting:\nThe program isn\u2019t universal. Benefits are available only to people who have worked a minimum number of hours of insurable employment during their qualifying periods.Footnote 14 The program provides partial and temporary income support. It spreads the risks related to the situations set out in the law across all insured persons. The program is funded primarily through employer and employee premiums. The law requires the Commission to set the premium rate for each year based on certain factors. The Commission\u2019s goal is to break even, in accordance with rigorous insurance principles.Footnote 15 The program isn\u2019t a social assistance program where benefits are determined based on the claimant\u2019s needs. Instead, the amount and duration of EI benefits are determined based on specific rules. The program isn\u2019t a savings account either. Contributing to the program alone doesn\u2019t entitle you to benefits. Workers have to pay premiums on all insurable earnings up to an annual maximum, even if they don\u2019t plan on getting benefits.Footnote 16\n[28] Since 2006, a federal-provincial agreement has made it possible for Quebec residents to get maternity, parental, adoption, and paternity benefits under the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP), rather than the similar benefits available under the Act.Footnote 17\n[29] In this decision, I largely disregard the fact that the Claimants received their parental and maternity benefits under the QPIP instead of the federal program. Both programs are closely integrated, and the Claimants never argued that their case was specific to women in Quebec. In fact, some of the Claimants received more benefits than if they had lived elsewhere in Canada.Footnote 18\nEI regular, maternity, and parental benefits [30] While other types of benefits are available under the Act, regular benefits and special benefits, including parental and maternity benefits, account for the vast majority of benefit payments.Footnote 19\n[31] EI regular benefits provide 14 to 45 weeks of support for insured persons who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.Footnote 20 To qualify for regular benefits, you need, among other things, between 420 and 700 hours of insurable employment in your qualifying period.Footnote 21\n[32] Maternity and parental benefits are among the special benefits available under the Act. To qualify for special benefits, you need 600 hours of insurable employment in your qualifying period.Footnote 22\n[33] On the one hand, biological mothers can claim up to 15 weeks of maternity benefits to support their physical and emotional recovery. The law provides some flexibility for biological mothers who want to get maternity benefits before or after giving birth.\n[34] On the other hand, parental benefits provide even more flexibility for parents, whether biological or adoptive, to help them care for their new children. Parental benefits may be paid to one parent or shared between parents. Parents who share benefits can get additional weeks of benefits.\n[35] In addition, parents can choose to receive parental benefits at a higher rate for a shorter period (the standard option) or at a lower rate for a longer period (the extended option).Footnote 23\n[36] While maternity and parental benefits support families and enable parents to care for their families, the purpose and primary effect of these benefits lie elsewhere. These benefits are, first and foremost, income replacement benefits, and they are meant to ensure a person\u2019s re-entry into the labour market.Footnote 24\n[37] In support of this conclusion, the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out that the Act doesn\u2019t grant time off work. Maternity leave and parental leave are governed by other legislation or by arrangements between employers and employees.\nThe EI program is based on a link between recent and active labour market attachment and the payment of benefits [38] The Act sets out two important concepts that ensure a short period of time between active labour market attachment and the payment of benefits: the qualifying period and the benefit period.\n[39] The qualifying period is the period during which an insured person must have worked enough hours of insurable employment to get EI benefits. It is calculated using the shorter of:\nthe 52-week period immediately before the beginning of a benefit period the period that begins on the first day of an immediately preceding benefit period and ends with the end of the week before the beginning of the benefit period for the new claim, if the insured person has already established a benefit periodFootnote 25\n[40] In the second situation, you can never use your hours of insurable employment more than once. Also, EI benefits and QPIP benefits aren\u2019t hours of insurable employment.\n[41] The qualifying period can be extended in certain situations that don\u2019t apply to the Claimants in this case.Footnote 26\n[42] The benefit period is the time when the Commission can pay benefits to an insured person. It is established only if the person qualifies. Its start date is determined based on the date of the interruption of earnings or the date of the application, depending on the situation.Footnote 27\n[43] The benefit period is normally 52 weeks, unless it is extended for one of the reasons set out in the law.Footnote 28 But, again, the Claimants don\u2019t qualify for benefit period extensions.\n[44] The Act also sets out the concept of a benefit window. This makes sure benefits are paid around the time of the event that caused you to claim them. For example, maternity benefits can start up to 12 weeks before the due date and end up to 17 weeks after the actual date of delivery.Footnote 29\nBenefits can be paid for a maximum number of weeks but can be combined in certain situations [45] Each type of benefit has its own limits, that is, a maximum number of weeks for which the Commission can pay benefits in a benefit period. For example, during a benefit period, you can get:\nup to 15 weeks of maternity benefits up to 35 weeks of parental benefits (under the standard option) 14 to 45 weeks of regular benefits, normally based on the regional rate of unemployment and the number of hours of insurable employment in your qualifying periodFootnote 30\n[46] You can be eligible for more than one type of benefit at the same time, but you can get only one type of benefit at a time.\n[47] If you meet all the requirements, you can combine regular and special benefits within your 52-week benefit period for up to 50 weeks of benefits.Footnote 31 The Claimants\u2019 constitutional challenge is about this 50-week limit.\n[48] The provisions of the law that make it possible to combine special benefits are complex.Footnote 32 However, special benefits can sometimes be combined, extending the benefit period beyond 52 weeks.Footnote 33 This means that, if the relevant conditions are met, an insured person can get all the weeks of special benefits they are entitled to during a benefit period that can be up to 104 weeks long.\nSection 15 of the Charter guarantees \u201csubstantive\u201d equality [49] Section 15(1) of the Charter reads:\n15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.\n[50] To establish a violation of section 15, the Claimants have to show that the challenged sections both:\ncreate a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground, on their face or in their impact impose burdens or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantageFootnote 34\n[51] The Supreme Court of Canada teaches us that discrimination can be direct or indirect. In other words, a seemingly neutral law can be discriminatory if it has a disproportionate impact on a protected group. This is called adverse impact discrimination.\n[52] In addition, I would note that section 15 protects the right to equality based on sex. However, the Claimants\u2019 arguments don\u2019t apply to all women. Instead, they apply to women who lost their jobs through no fault of their own shortly before or after the arrival of a new child.\n[53] Still, the Supreme Court has confirmed that claims of parental discrimination can often be brought as claims of adverse impact discrimination on the basis of sex.Footnote 35\n[54] Having provided some important background information, I will now proceed with my analysis of the General Division decision.\nThe General Division didn\u2019t make an error in finding that the challenged sections, in their impact, create a distinction based on an enumerated ground [55] In this case, the circumstances of each Claimant are slightly different. However, I see no need to highlight all these differences. In any case, the Claimants say that the challenged sections limited their access to EI regular benefits.\n[56] For the purposes of this decision, I accept that the Claimants have shown that the challenged sections, in their impact, create a distinction based on sex.\n[57] Two types of evidence can be used to prove that a law has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group: evidence about the situation of the claimant group and evidence about the outcomes that the law has produced in practice.Footnote 36\n[58] On this point, I especially note the following information that the Claimants provided, which the Commission didn\u2019t dispute and the General Division accepted:Footnote 37\nThe unequal division of domestic labour continues to be the main reason why women participate in the labour force less often than men and work fewer hours on average. In 2015, women with children under 18 did 60% of the housework, including 65% of the child care. They did only 39% of the paid work. In addition, the \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d lasts beyond the year a child is born. Women see their income drop by more than 40% during the perinatal period, except in cases where they get a supplement from the employer or another source. In addition, this effect continues even nine years after childbirth.Footnote 38 Women are still likely to be unemployed after maternity parental [sic] leave despite the provisions of provincial and federal legislation meant to protect them.Footnote 39 Women use 94.1% of their weeks of maternity and parental benefits, and 58.8% of other special benefits.Footnote 40 This means that a large number of new mothers are affected by the 50-week limit, while the number of men affected is very limited.Footnote 41\n[59] The facts of this case are similar to those that the Supreme Court of Canada considered in Fraser.Footnote 42\n[60] So, for the purposes of this decision, I am willing to accept that women with children are less likely than other insured persons to be able to access EI regular benefits and to be protected against the risk of job loss.\n[61] However, not all distinctions are discriminatory. This issue is addressed in the second part of the test in cases involving section 15 of the Charter.\nThe General Division made an error of law in finding that the challenged sections impose burdens or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage [62] I sympathize with the Claimants\u2019 situation and recognize that the 50-week rule has caused them financial hardship. The General Division found that, as a result of this rule, women are kept in poverty and in relationships of dependency, and their wages are considered less worthy of protection.Footnote 43\n[63] In its decision, the General Division relied heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Fraser.Footnote 44 It interpreted the decision as allowing it to minimize the importance of the legislative context in its analysis.\n[64] Following the General Division decision, the Supreme Court removed any uncertainty on this issue in Sharma: The legislative context is an important factor that courts have to consider when determining whether a distinction is discriminatory within the meaning of the Charter.Footnote 45 Specifically, the Court highlighted factors to be considered when assessing the legislative context:\nRelevant considerations include: the objects of the scheme, whether a policy is designed to benefit a number of different groups, the allocation of resources, particular policy goals sought to be achieved, and whether the lines are drawn mindful as to those factors \u2026.Footnote 46\n[65] So, I find that the General Division made an error of law in its analysis of the entire context of this situation, since it didn\u2019t consider the purpose of the EI program or its legislative context. Instead, this part of the General Division decision focuses on the Claimants\u2019 testimony and expert report.Footnote 47\n[66] When the entire context is considered, the challenged sections aren\u2019t arbitrary and don\u2019t deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage.\n[67] To begin with, the purpose of the program isn\u2019t to support families. It also isn\u2019t a universal benefit that goes to everyone who needs it.\n[68] First and foremost, the program provides income replacement benefits and ensures the recipient\u2019s re-entry into the labour market.Footnote 48 This income support is partial and temporary in nature. In addition, as I explained above, the program is based on a link between recent and active labour market attachment and the payment of benefits.\n[69] It is clear that maternity and parental benefits are consistent with the purposes of the law: They reduce the impact of an interruption of earnings and promote labour market re-entry. The issue of whether to grant additional benefits to vulnerable or disadvantaged people is beyond the purposes of the law and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n[70] The program was also designed to benefit a number of different groups, that is, for people who have had an interruption of earnings, for different reasons set out in the law.\n[71] In the paragraphs above, I have set out some of the complexities built into the design of this program. The program is meant to cover the competing interests of various groups. Broad lines had to be drawn to address the different needs of insured persons.Footnote 49 This includes the 50-week limit.\n[72] In addition, the 50-week limit concerns the allocation of resources. The limits set out in the Act are essential to the proper functioning and effectiveness of the program, just as they are for any other insurance program. They are important in determining the extent of the risk assumed. Changing these limits could get in the way of the Commission\u2019s goal of breaking even and could lead to higher premium rates.\n[73] Although the Claimants don\u2019t agree on where the line was drawn, they don\u2019t dispute the value of the program or the need to set limits. To be viable, the program has to break even, and the premium rate has to be kept low.\n[74] I recognize that a woman who gets 15 weeks of maternity benefits is limited to 35 weeks of EI regular benefits. But, the essential need to set limits in such a complex insurance program leads me to conclude that the 50-week limit isn\u2019t arbitrary and won\u2019t have the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating stereotypes or prejudices.Footnote 50\n[75] The Claimants were denied benefits, but not because their wages are less worthy of protection. Like many others, they simply ran up against one of the many limits set out in the Act.Footnote 51\n[76] The 50-week limit is just one of many limits imposed by the Act. It doesn\u2019t just apply to people who want to combine maternity, parental, and regular benefits. It applies to anyone who wants to combine regular benefits with any other type of special benefit.Footnote 52 In fact, even people who want to combine different types of special benefits encounter limits.Footnote 53\n[77] Although I noted earlier that this case resembles Fraser, the cases differ significantly at this second stage of the test.\n[78] In Fraser, the claimants job-shared, which caused them to work fewer hours and had a negative impact on their pensions.\n[79] However, other people working reduced hours were given the opportunity to buy back full-time pension credit for their service. This opportunity was denied to the participants in the job-sharing program, nearly all of whom were women.\n[80] This case is different, since anyone who wants to combine regular and special benefits is subject to the same 50-week limit.\n[81] In short, the 50-week limit doesn\u2019t create or reinforce a stereotype that women aren\u2019t valuable assets to the labour force. It also doesn\u2019t affect the dignity of women by suggesting that their work is less worthy of recognition. Anyone entitled to EI benefits will have to deal with various limits set by the program, which is both complex and narrowly targeted.\nThe Claimants used the program [82] The Claimants\u2019 argument is based on a lack of access to EI regular benefits. But, there is only one program, even if a person may be entitled to benefits based on different reasons related to their interruption of earnings.\n[83] The General Division made an error of law in paragraph 222 of its decision when it found that women who get parental and maternity benefits and lose their jobs are excluded from the program.\n[84] On the contrary, these women used the program up to the maximum available under the law.\n[85] The program provides temporary support if you have an interruption of earnings for a prescribed reason. Here, the Claimants had an interruption of earnings for a prescribed reason, and the Commission paid them benefits accordingly.\n[86] The adverse impact claimed by the Claimants must happen relatively rarely. It doesn\u2019t apply to all women, not even all women with children.\n[87] The problem for the Claimants is that their interruption of earnings was extended for another prescribed reason (loss of employment) within a short period of time.\n[88] However, the Commission can never pay more than one type of benefit at a time. Moreover, you can reach the 50-week limit in various scenarios.\n[89] Imagine, for example, someone who loses their job while caring for a critically ill child or while unable to work because of a health problem. Even women who don\u2019t work enough hours of insurable employment between two pregnancies will be denied benefits for the second pregnancy because they don\u2019t meet the requirements.Footnote 54\n[90] When people belonging to a protected group are faced with this problem, they could also mount constitutional challenges to remove even more limits set by the law. The Federal Court of Appeal has already warned against this situation.Footnote 55\n[91] Viewed from a different angle, the Claimants\u2019 problem is partly due to the fact that the Act improved the coverage available to pregnant women by increasing the limit for maternity and parental benefits to 50 weeks.\n[92] The Claimants would be at a disadvantage if parental benefits were reduced to 15 weeks, even if this gave them better coverage in the event of unemployment.\nBenefits schemes are difficult to strike down under section 15 of the Charter [93] Although the Act isn\u2019t immune from Charter scrutiny, equality challenges to the scheme have had little success.Footnote 56 The same goes for the Canada Pension Plan, which is a similar contributory scheme.Footnote 57\n[94] In Gosselin, the Supreme Court aptly stated:\nPerfect correspondence between a benefit program and the actual needs and circumstances of the claimant group is not required to find that a challenged provision does not violate the Canadian Charter. The situation of those who, for whatever reason, may have been incapable of participating in the programs attracts sympathy. Yet the inability of a given social program to meet the needs of each and every individual does not permit us to conclude that the program failed to correspond to the actual needs and circumstances of the affected group. As Iacobucci J. noted in Law, supra, at para. 105, we should not demand \u201cthat legislation must always correspond perfectly with social reality in order to comply with s. 15(1) of the Charter\u201d. Crafting a social assistance plan to meet the needs of young adults is a complex problem, for which there is no perfect solution. No matter what measures the government adopts, there will always be some individuals for whom a different set of measures might have been preferable. The fact that some people may fall through a program\u2019s cracks does not show that the law fails to consider the overall needs and circumstances of the group of individuals affected, or that distinctions contained in the law amount to discrimination in the substantive sense intended by s. 15(1).Footnote 58\n[95] In short, social reality is complex. While a social insurance scheme like the Act may attempt to meet the needs of various people, it can\u2019t be expected to be perfect. And perfection can\u2019t be demanded using the equality protections of the Charter.\n[96] I fully understand why the Claimants want to have a period to focus exclusively on their new children and then have time to look for new jobs. However, I find that the choice of granting them additional benefits is for Parliament to make, not the courts. Parliament is in a better position to assess how changing an important limit would affect a complex program such as EI.\n[97] The Federal Court of Appeal has reiterated this idea in different ways, including as follows:\nWhen presented with an argument that a complex statutory benefits scheme, such as unemployment insurance, has a differential adverse effect on some claimants contrary to section 15, the Court is not concerned with the desirability of extending the benefits in the manner sought. In the design of social benefit programs, priorities must be set, a task for which Parliament is better suited than the courts, and the Constitution should not be regarded as requiring judicial fine-tuning of the legislative scheme.Footnote 59\nI will give the decision the General Division should have given [98] Errors by the General Division allow me to give the decision the General Division should have given.Footnote 60 The parties agree that this is the most appropriate remedy in this case.\n[99] I agree. The facts of the case aren\u2019t really in dispute. Additionally, the parties weren\u2019t prevented from presenting their case before the General Division in any way. The appeal record is complete.\n[100] This means that I can decide whether the challenged sections are constitutional and whether the Claimants are entitled to additional EI regular benefits.\nThe challenged sections are constitutional [101] The analysis above shows that the Claimants haven\u2019t established that sections 8(2), 8(5), 10(2), 10(8)(a), 10(10), and 12(6) of the Act violate the Charter right to equality. The challenged sections are constitutional. This means that the Claimants are subject to the 50-week limit and aren\u2019t eligible for any more EI regular benefits.\nConclusion [102] I am allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal. The General Division made an error of law in finding that the challenged sections deny the Claimants a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage. More specifically, the General Division didn\u2019t sufficiently consider the purpose and legislative context of the EI program.\n[103] This error allows me to give the decision the General Division should have given. I find that the challenged sections are constitutional. This means that the Claimants aren\u2019t entitled to any more EI regular benefits.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nThese benefits are available under the Employment Insurance Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSpecifically, the appeal concerns sections 8(2), 8(5), 10(2), 10(8)(a), 10(10), and 12(6) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nI recognize that some of the Claimants received more than 50 weeks of benefits because of the provisions of the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan, which are more advantageous in some respects: See V. D.\u2019s situation in appeal file AD-22-95. What is important, however, is that all the Claimants were denied EI regular benefits because of the parental and maternity benefits they had already received.\nFootnote 4\nSee sections 58(1)(a) and 58(1)(b) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.

C.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (0) dated October 12, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Raelene R. Thomas\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: December 14, 2023\nHearing participant: Appellant\nDecision date: January 3, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-2908\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Matters I considered first Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed. The Tribunal agrees with the Appellant.Footnote 1\n[2] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) has not proven the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct (in other words, because he did something that caused him to lose his job). This means the Appellant is not disqualified from receiving EI benefits.Footnote 2\nOverview [3] The Appellant was dismissed from his job. The Appellant\u2019s employer said he was let go because he refused to sign off on two of the employer\u2019s policies.\n[4] Even though the Appellant doesn\u2019t dispute this happened, he says that it isn\u2019t the real reason why the employer let him go. The Appellant says the employer let him go because a few weeks after his supervisor had a confrontation with the Appellant, he decided the Appellant had to sign a new policy and an existing policy. Before this, the supervisor accepted that the Appellant\u2019s signature on his employment contract was acknowledgement of the policies.\n[5] The Commission accepted the employer\u2019s reason for the dismissal. It decided the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct. Because of this, the Commission decided the Appellant is disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\nMatters I considered first The Appellant\u2019s appeal was returned to the General Division [6] The Appellant first appealed the denial of EI benefits to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division in March 2023. The General Division member dismissed the Appellant\u2019s appeal because she found the Appellant knew he would likely be dismissed if he did not sign the documents and his refusal to sign the documents was wilful, conscious and deliberate. This meant the Appellant had lost his job due to his own misconduct.\n[7] The Appellant appealed the General Division\u2019s decision to the Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division. The Appeal Division found the General Division did not consider the employer\u2019s conduct prior to the Appellant\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d to properly assess whether his conduct was intentional or not.Footnote 3 The Appeal Division ordered the appeal be returned to the General Division for reconsideration by a different Tribunal Member. This decision is a result of the second hearing.\nThe hearing was adjourned [8] The hearing was initially scheduled for November 30, 2023. Prior to that hearing the Appellant submitted a copy of Minutes of Settlement (Minutes) he reached with his employer. He said that, as part of the settlement, the employer agreed he has been terminated without cause and it reissued the Record of Employment (ROE) to show this. The Appellant said at the hearing he had been talking to representatives at Service Canada who agreed he did not commit misconduct.\n[9] I explained to the Appellant he could chose to withdraw his appeal given the statements made by Service Canada officers, or I could ask the Commission to provide a submission on whether the Minutes changed its position. The Appellant agreed to the latter and, if the Commission\u2019s position was unchanged, the hearing would continue on December 14, 2023. The Commission\u2019s position did not change so the hearing continued on December 14, 2023 as scheduled.\nThe employer is not an added party [10] Sometimes the Tribunal sends an Appellant\u2019s former employer a letter asking if they want to be added as a party to the appeal. In this case, the Tribunal sent the employer a letter. The employer did not reply to the letter.\n[11] To be an added party, the employer must have a direct interest in the appeal. I have decided not to add the employer as a party to this appeal, because there is nothing in the file that indicates my decision would impose any legal obligations on the employer.\nThe minutes of settlement [12] The Federal Court has said before a settlement agreement can be used to contradict an earlier finding of the Commission, there must be some evidence which would contradict the position taken by the employer during the investigation by the Commission.Footnote 4\n[13] There is no evidence the employer changed its reasons for dismissing the Appellant. As a result, and, given my findings the Commission has not met its burden of proving misconduct, I have not taken the Minutes into consideration in reaching my decision.\nIssue [14] Did the Appellant lose his job because of misconduct?\nAnalysis [15] To answer the question of whether the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct, I have to decide two things. First, I have to determine why the Appellant lost his job. Then, I have to determine whether the law considers that reason to be misconduct.\nWhy did the Appellant lose his job? [16] I find that the Appellant lost his job because he refused to sign the policies his employer asked him to sign.\n[17] The Appellant and the Commission don\u2019t agree on why the Appellant lost his job. The Commission says the reason the employer gave is the real reason for the dismissal. Representatives of the employer told the Commission the Appellant was dismissed for refusal to sign off on employer documents which were a condition of his employment. The employer\u2019s representative said it was not the Appellant\u2019s behaviour leading to the disciplinary action that resulted in his dismissal, but rather the refusing to the sign the documents required after the disciplinary action.\n[18] The Appellant disagrees. The Appellant says the real reason he was dismissed from his job is because a few weeks before the dismissal his supervisor got into an argument with him in front of the Appellant\u2019s subordinate. The supervisor later apologized but then asked the Appellant to sign off on a verbal warning that said Appellant exhibited unacceptable conduct, was confrontational with the supervisor and acted unprofessionally and also required him to sign off on two select employer policies. The Appellant refused to sign off on the letter, because he said that was not what happened. He also refused to sign the policies because his employer had previously agreed his signature on his original employment contract was a satisfactory signoff on the employer\u2019s policies.\n[19] The letter of termination issued to the Appellant says that action was necessary because the Appellant failed to sign off on the company policies, procedures and employee handbook. Because of this the employer determined the terms of the employment relationship were irreparably breached.\n[20] I think the Appellant was dismissed for his refusal to sign the policies as requested by his employer. The evidence shows the Appellant was asked to sign the policies and he told his employer he would not sign.\nIs the reason for the Appellant\u2019s dismissal misconduct under the law? [21] The reason for the Appellant\u2019s dismissal is not misconduct under the law.\n[22] To be misconduct under the law, the conduct has to be wilful. This means the conduct was conscious, deliberate, or intentional.Footnote 5 Misconduct also includes conduct that is so reckless that it is almost wilful.Footnote 6 The Appellant doesn\u2019t have to have wrongful intent (in other words, he doesn\u2019t have to mean to be doing something wrong) for his behaviour to be misconduct under the law.Footnote 7\n[23] There is misconduct if the Appellant knew or should have known his conduct could get in the way of carrying out his duties toward his employer and that there was a real possibility of being let go because of that.Footnote 8\n[24] The Commission has to prove the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct. The Commission has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means it has to show it is more likely than not the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct.Footnote 9\n[25] To determine whether the misconduct could result in dismissal, there must be a causal link between the claimant\u2019s misconduct and the claimant\u2019s employment.Footnote 10\n[26] The Commission says there was misconduct because the Appellant was aware if he failed to sign the company policies it would lead to his dismissal. It says the Appellant made a conscious choice to refuse to comply. The Commission submitted it did not have the burden to prove the employer\u2019s policies were reasonable or fair, or that the employer\u2019s conduct is relevant. It says there are other avenues where the Appellant can raise these arguments. The Commission said it was reasonable for the employer to change policies over time and to require employees to acknowledge and sign such policies.\n[27] With respect to the Minutes reached between the Appellant and his former employer, the Commission submits the Minutes do not contain any evidence to contradict the previous findings of misconduct. It is a decision and agreement of the parties to resolve the matter amicably. The Commission says the decision between the Appellant and his employer does not prove that misconduct did not occur.\n[28] The Appellant says there was no misconduct because his employer had no reason to fire him for cause. He says he committed no misconduct in the four years he was working. He received full performance bonuses and did not stop doing his duties despite the abuse from his employer as documented in the appeal file.\n[29] The Appellant testified he was given permission to work from home. He was the social media coordinator and marketing manager. Part of his duties involved editing videos. The videos would be shot at the employer\u2019s locations. He used his personal computer equipment and software to do the editing with the employer\u2019s permission because the employer did not want to supply the equipment or software. The Appellant said he had an office at one of his employer\u2019s locations.\n[30] The Appellant testified a subordinate was hired in 2022 to perform some of the video work. The subordinate asked him to come into work with him one day. The Appellant and the subordinate were in an office following the lunch break talking about non-work things. The Appellant said his supervisor approached him in the office and abused him in front of the subordinate and apologized in the same breath.\n[31] The Appellant spoke to a Service Canada officer on February 8, 2023. The Appellant told a Service Canada officer that the supervisor started yelling at the Appellant and the subordinate for sitting around for 30 minutes talking about non-work stuff when they say they are always busy and that working from home was stupid, it doesn\u2019t work, and no one should be allowed to work from home. The Appellant told the officer he asked the supervisor if he could speak to him in private. The supervisor continued to talk about people working from home being lazy. At which point the Appellant asked the supervisor where he was for three months. The supervisor had been working from another country. At that point, the Appellant said, the supervisor apologized, said he overreacted because he was stressed and took it out in the Appellant.\n[32] The Appellant testified after the confrontation he returned to the worksite and started working from his office. He was then told he could work from home one or two days a week.\n[33] The Appellant testified he signed an employment contract that said he agreed to adhere to company policies and that those polices could change. Over the course of four years, his supervisor would ask if he signed the employee handbook. The Appellant would reply no, I\u2019ve signed the employment contract and he would be told \u201coh, okay, that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n[34] The Appellant testified that about three weeks after the confrontation the employee handbook came up again. He said with no warning his supervisor approached him on August 29, 2022, and wanted to discipline him because the supervisor said it was the Appellant who had abused him. The Appellant was expected to agree with this version of events. He was asked to sign what he assumed were extracts (two policies) from the company handbook that would allow the employer to fire him for anything he did outside his workplace that did not agree with his employer\u2019s views. The Appellant said he told his employer he would not be comfortable signing that.\n[35] The two policies the Appellant were asked to sign are in the appeal file. One is called \u201cAttitude and Conduct Policy.\u201d The other is called \u201cCode of Conduct.\u201d The policies are not dated. The Appellant testified the Attitude and Conduct Policy was modified to say all employees were expected to maintain a level of personal conduct that will not reflect negatively on the employer and employees whose conduct compromised the integrity of the employer could face disciplinary measures up to and including termination. The Appellant could not say if the Code of Conduct had been amended. The Appellant testified no other employee was asked to sign the modified Attitude and Conduct Policy at the time he was asked to sign it.\n[36] The Appellant thought he would continue working if he did not sign the policies or the warning. He spoke to his family and a lawyer \u2013 all said it was unnecessary for him to sign the documents. There had been no misconduct. The Appellant said he was not given a copy of the employee handbook when he was hired. There were employee handbooks around the office, he said he was familiar with the policies and followed them.\n[37] The Appellant testified he received the letter dated September 1, 2022 from his supervisor. That letter said the Appellant had until the start of his shift on September 6, 2022 to provide proper signoff to the attached documents (the two policies). The letter went on to say because signoff was a condition of his employment, refusal to comply would result in a temporary unpaid suspension or termination of employment.\n[38] The Appellant reported to work on September 6, 2023 and worked until noon when he was dismissed.\n[39] The Appellant submitted that his employer reached a settlement with him whereby the employer agreed to remove \u201cfired for cause.\u201d He was paid severance in accordance with his contract of employment and received money for his legal expenses.\n[40] As noted above, with respect to the first decision by the General Division on this appeal, the Appeal Division member found the General Division did not consider the employer\u2019s conduct prior to the Appellant\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d to properly assess whether his conduct was intentional or not.Footnote 11\n[41] In Astolfi, the Federal Court said that focussing only on a claimant\u2019s conduct is too narrow an application of the legal test for misconduct because there is a distinction between an employer\u2019s conduct after alleged misconduct, and an employer\u2019s conduct which may have led to the \u201cmisconduct\u201d in the first place.Footnote 12\n[42] In Astolfi, Mr. Astolfi felt that the president and CEO of the company had harassed him during a meeting. After the meeting, Mr. Astolfi told his employer he would continue working from home until the situation had been investigated and resolved. The employer ordered Mr. Astolfi to be physically present at the workplace. Otherwise, it would deem he had abandoned his job. Mr. Astolfi did not report to the workplace. The employer considered this \u201cmisconduct\u201d, so the employer dismissed him. According to Mr. Astolfi, his refusal to show up at work was a direct result of his employer\u2019s actions before the misconduct.\n[43] The Federal Court held in Astolfi, it would be reasonable for the General Division to consider the employer\u2019s conduct before the Appellant\u2019s misconduct. (emphasis added). This would allow the General Division to properly assess whether Mr. Astolfi\u2019s conduct was intentional or not. The Federal Court concluded that the General Division had to consider Mr. Astolfi\u2019s allegations of harassment in the full context.\n[44] In my view, an assessment of whether an appellant\u2019s \u201cconduct was intentional or not\u201d is in effect, an assessment of whether an appellant\u2019s conduct was wilful, conscious or deliberate in the context of the employer\u2019s actions that led to the appellant\u2019s conduct.\n[45] The Appellant says his employer was abusive when he confronted the Appellant and his subordinate for talking about non-work things. The confrontation occurred two to three weeks before the supervisor asked the Appellant to sign a verbal warning letter and two select policies.\n[46] The verbal warning letter referred to the Appellant\u2019s \u201cperformance\/productivity and unprofessional conduct and work performance not meeting company standards.\u201d The letter required the appellant to be on location for each shift until there was a significant improvement in performance and behaviour.\n[47] The letter also said:\n\u201cThere has been a recent incident with the [supervisor] regarding your reaction when approached regarding a discussion with another employee. You became very confrontational and when there was an attempt to deescalate the situation you returned and acted in an unprofessional manner in the presence to (sic) other employees.\u201d\n[48] The letter went on to say, \u201cIn addition to this warning, you are responsible for reviewing and signing off on the attached \u201cAttitude and Conduct\u201d and \u201cCode of Conduct\u201d Polices and return to me by no later than August 30, 2022.\u201d\n[49] The evidence tells me it was the confrontation with the supervisor that led to the verbal warning letter and the Appellant\u2019s later dismissal. I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that the supervisor instigated the confrontation and apologized for it. The Appellant has been consistent in his version of events when speaking to Service Canada officers, in his appeal and in his testimony before me.\n[50] The Appellant felt he was dismissed because of the confrontation and the supervisor\u2019s embarrassment over that confrontation. The Appellant believed the request to sign the two policies was a direct result of the confrontation. The Appellant interpreted the request that he sign the two policies to be a means by which the employer could fire him at any time for any future behaviour they disagreed with. The employer had previously accepted his signature on the employment contract as sufficient acknowledgment of the policies. For this reason, the Appellant did not think he could be dismissed for refusing to sign the two policies.\n[51] The employer\u2019s representative told a Service Canada officer it was not the Appellant\u2019s behaviour leading to the disciplinary action that resulted in his dismissal, but rather the refusing to sign the documents required after the disciplinary action. (emphasis added) The employer representative went on to say, had the Appellant signed the documents, he would not have been dismissed from his employment.\n[52] I find, based on a balance of probabilities, the Appellant\u2019s refusal to sign the policies is not misconduct.\n[53] The evidence is clear the employer had, for four years, accepted the Appellant\u2019s signature on the employment contract as sufficient acknowledgement of the employer\u2019s policies. The evidence is equally clear the requirement to sign off on two select policies only arose some weeks after the Appellant and his supervisor had a confrontation. The employer required the Appellant to sign the two select policies in the context of also signing a verbal warning to express his agreement with the supervisor\u2019s version of events of the confrontation.\n[54] The Appellant refused to agree with the supervisor\u2019s version of events. He was not disciplined or dismissed for his behavior during the confrontation. He was not dismissed for refusing to agree to the supervisor\u2019s version of events. Instead, the reason for the dismissal morphed into the Appellant\u2019s refusal to sign off on the two select policies as requested by the employer in the context of a verbal letter of warning.\n[55] In my view, this means the dismissal for the refusal to sign the policies was an excuse for the Appellant\u2019s dismissal and not the reason for the dismissal. As a result, I find that, while the Appellant did choose to not sign off on the select policies, his conduct was not wilful, conscious or deliberate, because his employer was using the refusal to sign off a guise for his dismissal. This means the Commission has not met its burden of proving the Appellant lost his job due to his own misconduct within the meaning of the EI Act and case law cited above.\nSo, did the Appellant lose his job because of misconduct? [56] Based on my findings above, I find the Appellant did not lose his job because of misconduct.\nConclusion [57] The Commission has not proven the Appellant lost his job because of misconduct. Because of this, the Appellant is not disqualified from receiving EI benefits.\n[58] This means the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nA person who applies for employment insurance (EI) benefits is a \u201cclaimant.\u201d A person who appeals to the Tribunal is an \u201cappellant.\u201d\nFootnote 2\nSection 30 of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) says that appellants who lose their job because of misconduct are disqualified from receiving benefits.\nFootnote 3\nIn a footnote to this finding, the Appeal Division cited Astolfi v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 30.\nFootnote 4\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Courchene, 2007 FCA 183.

S.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated September 11, 2023 (GE-23-1442)\nTribunal member: Stephen Bergen\nDecision date: January 9, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-998\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] An extension of time to apply to the Appeal Division is granted. Leave (permission) to appeal is refused. The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant is the Estate of D. S. (the Estate). I will refer to the late D. S. as the Claimant because the appeal concerns her claim for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\n[3] The Respondent, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission), paid the Claimant benefits under the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefits program (EI-ERB). Under this program, claimants were entitled to a $500.00 weekly benefit if they met the requirements. To get support to claimant\u2019s quickly, the law authorized the Commission to immediately prepay benefits.Footnote 1 The Commission advanced claimants $2,000.00 of the EI-ERB benefits to which they would be eligible in later weeks. The Commission expected to recover the advance by withholding payment of the EI-ERB benefit in some of those weeks.\n[4] The Claimant received this $2,000.00 advance. However, she returned to work and stopped claiming the EI-ERB benefit before the Commission had a chance to recover the advance. As a result, the Commission sent the Claimant a Notice of Debt to recover it.\n[5] When the Claimant filed her request for reconsideration, she disagreed that she should have to repay the $2,000.00 advance. She argued that she applied for EI and received CERB instead. She stated that the overpayment was the government\u2019s mistake, and she could not afford to repay it.Footnote 2\n[6] Before the Commission could make a decision on the reconsideration request, the Claimant passed away. The Commission decided that it was not changing its decision and sent the decision to the Estate representative. The Estate appealed to the General Division of the Social Security Tribunal (Tribunal), but the General Division dismissed the appeal. The Estate is now seeking leave to appeal to the Appeal Division.\n[7] I am refusing leave to appeal because the Estate has no reasonable chance of success in this appeal. It has not made out an arguable case that the General Division made an error of procedural fairness or an error of law, or an important error of fact.\nIssues [8] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Was the application to the Appeal Division late? b) Should I extend the time for filing the application? c) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error of procedural fairness? d) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error of law? e) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an important error of fact?\nAnalysis The application was late [9] In its Notice of Appeal to the General Division, the Estate provided a mailing address, but did not authorize the Tribunal to communicate with the Estate by email. The General Division issued its decision on September 11, 2023, and mailed it to the Estate the same day.\n[10] Where the Tribunal sends a document to a party by regular mail, its Rules state that it considers the recipient to have received the document ten days after the day it was sent.Footnote 3 The Rules also allow that a party can show that this rule should not apply to them.Footnote 4\n[11] In the Estate\u2019s application to the Appeal Division, its representative could not say when he received the General Division decision. There is no evidence in the Tribunal file of the date the Estate received the decision.\n[12] The Estate has not shown that the document delivery rule should not apply, which means that it does apply. The Estate must be presumed to have received the decision ten days after the day it was sent. It was sent on September 11, 2023, so the Estate is deemed to have received the written decision on September 21, 2023.\n[13] The deadline to appeal a decision of the General Division to the Appeal Division is 30 days from the date that it is communicated in writing. The deadline would be October 21, 2023.\n[14] The Appeal Division did not receive the Estate\u2019s application until November 2, 2023.\n[15] The appeal is late.\nI am extending the time for filing the application [16] When deciding whether to grant an extension of time, I must consider whether the Estate has a reasonable explanation for why the application is late.Footnote 5\n[17] The Estate\u2019s representative explained that he had contacted his Member of Provincial Parliament and sought legal advice from the Kinna-aweya legal clinic in his home city. He says that both were too busy to help him right away.\n[18] I accept that the Estate has a reasonable explanation for the delay. The delay was only 12 days and was due in part to the Estate\u2019s representative having difficulty obtaining advice in a timely manner.\nI am not giving the Estate permission to appeal General Principles [19] For the Estate\u2019s application for leave to appeal to succeed, its reasons for appealing would have to fit within the \u201cgrounds of appeal.\u201d The grounds of appeal identify the kinds of errors that I can consider.\n[20] I may consider only the following errors:\na) The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. b) The General Division did not decide an issue that it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide (error of jurisdiction). c) The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. d) The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.Footnote 6\n[21] To grant this application for leave and permit the appeal process to move forward, I must find that there is a reasonable chance of success on one or more grounds of appeal. Other court decisions have equated a reasonable chance of success to an \u201carguable case.\u201dFootnote 7\nError of procedural fairness [22] One of the grounds of appeal selected by the Estate\u2019s representative was the one concerned with procedural fairness.\n[23] However, the Estate has not made out an arguable case that the General Division acted unfairly.\n[24] Procedural fairness is concerned with the fairness of the process. It is not concerned with whether a party feels that the decision result is fair.\n[25] Parties before the General Division have a right to certain procedural protections such as the right to be heard and to know the case against them, and the right to an unbiased decision-maker.\n[26] The Estate\u2019s representative attended an in-person hearing at the General Division. He has not said that the General Division did not give the Estate a fair chance to prepare for the hearing or that he did not know what was going on in the hearing. He has not said that he did not have a fair chance to present the Estate\u2019s case or to respond to the Commission\u2019s case. He has not complained that the General Division member was biased or that he had already prejudged the matter.\n[27] When I read the decision and review the appeal record, I do not see that the General Division did anything, or failed to do anything, that causes me to question the fairness of the process.\nError of law [28] The Estate representative is not sure why the Claimant disagreed with the decision but says that he believes the General Division made an error of law.\n[29] He mentions that section 153.1306 of the Employment Insurance Act allows that the Commission may write off overpayments where the debtor is deceased.\n[30] There is no arguable case that the General Division erred in law when it stated that it had no authority to write off the debt. While the Commission has a discretionary power to write off the debt, the General Division does not. Nor does it have the authority to consider an appeal of a Commission refusal to write off the debt. As noted by the General Division, it would be prudent for the Estate to make a formal request that the Commission write off the debt, if it has not already done so.\n[31] I note that the Claimant sought the reconsideration because she applied for regular EI and received \u201cCERB\u201d (which was actually the EI-ERB benefit).\n[32] There is no arguable case that the General Division made any legal error or error of jurisdiction by considering only whether she should have to repay the EI-ERB.\n[33] The General Division is only authorized to consider those issues set out in the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision.Footnote 8 The Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision was dated May 4, 2023. The reconsideration decision identifies the issue as the \u201cEmployment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit Overpayment.\u201d It says that the Commission is \u201cmaintaining\u201d (not changing) its decision on this issue.\n[34] There is no reason to believe that the subject of the reconsideration decision was anything other than the repayment of the $2,000.00 that was advanced under the EI-ERB provisions. The Claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration references the \u201cCERB\u201d benefit repayment.\u201d She discussed the repayment issue with the Commission on July 6, 2022, after receiving the notice of debt on July 5, 2022. When the Estate spoke to the Commission on May 4, 2023, about the reconsideration request, the discussion centered on the repayment of the EI-ERB advance and the overpayment.\n[35] The Claimant may not have received the regular EI benefit that she applied for but there is no arguable case that the General Division made any legal or factual error related to the nature of the benefits paid to her. It was correct that the Commission had no choice but to treat applications for regular and sickness benefias applications for the EI-ERB between March 15, 2020, and September 26, 2020.\nError of fact [36] The Estate\u2019s representative says that the General Division made an error of fact in not considering the evidence of \u201cCharlene\u201d, a Service Canada worker.Footnote 9\n[37] The Estate\u2019s representative did not elaborate. However, I recognize that the Estate\u2019s representative is the late Claimant\u2019s husband and not a lawyer or professional advocate. He may not have clearly understood how to identify potential errors in the General Division decision. As a result, I have followed the lead of the courts and reviewed the record to see if the General Division made an important error of fact by misunderstanding or ignoring relevant evidence.Footnote 10\n[38] In particular, I have reviewed Charlene\u2019s notes in the Commission file. Charlene is the agent that followed up on the Claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration. She explained to the Estate\u2019s representative why the Claimant was obliged to repay the advance.\n[39] The agent also sought information from both the Estate and from the employer to see if the Commission might be able to offset any part of the paid advance against other weeks of unclaimed benefits (to which the Claimant might have been entitled if she had filed claims). The agent ruled out this possibility with the earnings information she receive from the employer.\n[40] I see nothing in any of the agent\u2019s notes, or in the Commission file generally, that suggests an arguable case that the General Division ignored anything relevant.\n[41] Unfortunately for the Estate, I have not found any instance in which the General Division may have mishandled the evidence.\n[42] There is no arguable case that the General Division made an important error of fact.\nConclusion [43] I have granted an extension of time is granted. However, I have refused permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee 153.7(1.1) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee GD3-80.\nFootnote 3\nIt says this in section 22(1) of the Social Security Tribunal Rules of Procedure (Rules).\nFootnote 4\nIt says this in section 22(4) of the Rules.\nFootnote 5\nIt says this in section 27(2) of the Social Security Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\nFootnote 6\nThis is a plain-language version of the grounds of appeal.

The appeal won\u2019t go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] D. L. (Claimant) applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefit on November 23, 2021. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused her application. She asked it to reconsider. In a reconsideration letter dated September 13, 2022, the Minister maintained its initial decision refusing the application.Footnote 1\n[3] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal on November 10, 2023.Footnote 2 The General Division did not allow the appeal to go ahead because the Claimant filed the appeal more than a year after the Minister communicated its reconsideration decision. The Claimant asked for permission to appeal to the Appeal Division.\nIssues [4] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Could the General Division have made an error of fact by ignoring important evidence about why the Claimant was late? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [5] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the facts to the law.Footnote 3\n[6] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 4\n[7] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence that is relevant to the issue I must decide, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t shown an arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring important evidence. [8] There\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring important evidence. The Claimant argues that the General Division ignored the bad advice a provincial government employee gave her about waiting before she appealed.Footnote 5\n[9] The General Division decision explains that in no case can the Tribunal proceed with an appeal that a claimant files more than a year after the Minister communicates its decision.Footnote 6 The Claimant didn\u2019t disagree about whether she was more than a year late. The General Division had no option to extend that deadline based on the bad advice she explained that she received from a provincial government employee.\n[10] I cannot find that the General Division may have made an error by ignoring the evidence about why the Claimant was late. There was no option in law for the General Division to grant the extension, regardless of the reason the Claimant needed it.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any new evidence that would justify granting permission to appeal. [11] The Claimant provided a functional capacity assessment dated July 28, 2023.Footnote 7 I think that this is evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division. However, since the Claimant filed the application to the General Division more than a year after the Minister communicated its decision, the assessment isn\u2019t relevant to the question I must decide and therefore cannot form the basis for giving permission to appeal.\n[12] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence about when the Minister communicated its decision or when the Claimant filed the appeal.Footnote 8\nConclusion [13] I\u2019ve refused the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not go ahead.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee GD2-4.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD1.\nFootnote 3\nSee sections 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.\nFootnote 4\nSee section 58.1(c) in the Act.\nFootnote 5\nSee AD1-4 and AD1-10 and following.\nFootnote 6\nSee paragraph 8 in the General Division decision, which describes section 52(2) of the Act.\nFootnote 7\nSee AD1-15 and following.\nFootnote 8\nFor more on the need for this kind of review by the Appeal Division, see Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General),\n",

F.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nRepresentative: Daniel McRoberts\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated March 8, 2023 (GE-22-2995)\nTribunal member: Janet Lew\nType of hearing: In Writing\nDecision date: January 9, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-339\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is dismissed. Even if the General Division misread a document, it did not change the outcome.\nOverview [2] The Appellant, B. F. (Claimant), is appealing the General Division decision. The General Division found that the Respondent, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission), proved that the Claimant lost her job because of misconduct. In other words, she had done something or had failed to do something that caused her to lose her job. The General Division found that she had not complied with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy. As a result, the Claimant was disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance benefits.\n[3] The Claimant argues that the General Division made jurisdictional, procedural, legal, and factual errors. In particular, she argues that she did not get a fair hearing. she also argues that the General Division made an important factual error about whether she had complied with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[4] Under the policy, the Claimant was required to disclose her vaccination status. The Claimant says that she disclosed her vaccination status and therefore complied with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy. Having complied with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy, she denies that she committed any misconduct.\n[5] The Claimant asks the Appeal Division to find that she did not commit any misconduct and to find that she is entitled to receive Employment Insurance benefits.\n[6] The Commission agrees that the General Division made a factual error when it found that the Claimant had failed to report her vaccination status. However, the Commission argues that the General Division\u2019s error does not change the outcome as it says that she still committed misconduct. The Commission asks the Appeal Division to dismiss the appeal.\nIssues [7] The issues in this appeal are as follows:\na) Did the Claimant get a fair hearing? b) Did the General Division fail to apply the Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles? c) Did the General Division fail to decide whether the Claimant had been wrongfully dismissed? d) Did the General Division properly weigh the evidence? e) Did the General Division overlook some of the evidence relating to her medical fitness? f) Did the General Division make a factual error about why the Claimant\u2019s employer dismissed her from her employment? g) Did the General Division misread the evidence? h) If the answer is \u201cyes\u201d to any of the above, does that change the outcome?\nAnalysis [8] The Appeal Division may intervene in General Division decisions if the General Division made any jurisdictional, procedural, legal, or certain types of factual errors.Footnote 1\n[9] For these types of factual errors, the General Division had to have based its decision on that error, and had to have made the error in a perverse or capricious manner, or without regard for the evidence before it.Footnote 2\nThe General Division gave the Claimant a fair hearing [10] The General Division conducted a fair hearing. Although it accepted documents from the Commission after the hearing, the member gave the Claimant a fair opportunity to respond. The Claimant was able to file a response. Ultimately, the member did not accept the Claimant\u2019s response, ruling that the document was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. But that did not mean the process was unfair as the General Division was entitled to assess the document and determine its admissibility.\n[11] The Claimant argues that the General Division failed to give her a fair hearing because it accepted evidence and submissions from the Commission after the hearing on January 25, 2023, while rejecting her response to that document.\n[12] The Social Security Tribunal (Tribunal) received supplementary representations from the Commission on January 25, 2023 (marked as GD10). The Commission was responding to the Claimant\u2019s documents (GD8) that she had filed on (Sunday) January 22, 2023. (The Tribunal did not manage to circulate the Claimant\u2019s late document to the Commission until the day before the hearing.)\n[13] In its supplementary representations post-hearing (GD10), the Commission argued that the Claimant\u2019s new documents (GD8) were largely irrelevant, other than an exchange of email that the Claimant had with her case manager. The Commission argued that the emails showed that, despite her sick leave, the Claimant was aware that she had to follow her employer\u2019s vaccination policy. Otherwise, she faced dismissal.Footnote 3\n[14] The Claimant seems to be suggesting that the General Division should have rejected the Commission\u2019s post-hearing document (GD10) because the hearing had already concluded. However, the Commission was responding to documents (GD8) that the Claimant had filed close to the hearing date.\n[15] The Tribunal wrote to the Claimant by email on February 2, 2023.Footnote 4 The Tribunal told the Claimant that it had received documents (GD10) from the Commission after the hearing. The member accepted the document. The Tribunal wrote, \u201cif you have any additional arguments in response to the document, we must receive them by February 10, 2023.\u201d\n[16] This timeframe was reasonable. The facts and issues involved were fairly straightforward.\n[17] The Claimant contacted the Tribunal on February 17, 2023. The Claimant advised that she had missed the letter from the Tribunal inviting her to provide a response to the Commission\u2019s post-hearing document by February 10, 2023. Although the deadline had passed, the Tribunal still invited her to submit a response. The Claimant subsequently sent an email to the Tribunal with her arguments.\n[18] The Claimant questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. She had taken a screen shot of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s list of possible adverse events of vaccines.\n[19] The General Division did not accept the Claimant\u2019s email. The member explained that the Claimant\u2019s submissions were not relevant to any of the legal issues.Footnote 5 The General Division determined that it \u201c[could not] second-guess the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines, or the reasonableness of an employer\u2019s COVID vaccination policy.\u201dFootnote 6\n[20] The Claimant says that this was unfair but the General Division was entitled to determine whether to accept or reject the Claimant\u2019s documents on the basis of relevancy. (Had the General Division accepted the Claimant\u2019s post-hearing response, as the Claimant says it should have, it would have then become an issue of the weight to assign to the response. But, this would not have satisfied the Claimant either. There is no doubt that the General Division would not have assigned any weight to her post-hearing evidence.)\n[21] The General Division provided the Claimant with a copy of the Commission\u2019s post-hearing document and also provided her with a reasonable chance to respond. She filed a response. So, it cannot be said that the Claimant did not get a fair hearing. The General Division was entitled to determine the relevancy and admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s response.\nThe General Division did not make a legal error by failing to apply the Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles [22] The General Division did not make a legal error by failing to apply the Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles.Footnote 7 The Claimant\u2019s allegations are against the Commission, rather than against the General Division.\n[23] The Claimant argues that the General Division failed to apply Chapter 7 of the Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles. She says that Chapter 7 requires the Commission to objectively evaluate the facts as presented by a claimant and their employer, and then decide in favour of the version of facts that seems the most credible. Chapter 7 does not say anything about what can be expected from the General Division.\n[24] The Digest can be used as a guide by the General Division to interpret the Employment Insurance Act and the Employment Insurance Regulations. But the case law says that the Digest is not binding and does not replace the law itself.\n[25] In a case called Greey, the Federal Court of Appeal described the Digest as \u201can interpretive guide that is not binding.\u201dFootnote 8 However, it \u201cis entitled to consideration and may constitute an important factor in the interpretation of statutes\u201d.Footnote 9\n[26] Apart from the fact that the General Division was not required to follow the Digest, the Claimant\u2019s allegations are against the Commission.\n[27] The Claimant says the Commission did not follow the Digest because it did not give her copies of its notes or a chance to respond to statements that her employer reportedly gave to the Commission. Her employer reportedly said that Employee Health cleared her for a return to work in December 2021. The Claimant denies that her physician medically cleared her for a for a return to work then.\n[28] It may be that the Claimant did not receive copies of her employer\u2019s statements or get a full chance to respond to statements before the Commission made its decision or reconsidered its decision. But these shortcomings are those of the Commission, not of the General Division. They do not form the basis for a ground of appeal against the General Division.\n[29] While there may have been procedural shortcomings in the Commission\u2019s handling of the claim, the General Division addressed them. The Tribunal provided both parties with a copy of all of the documents. The General Division also gave the Claimant a chance to fully respond to anything. She was permitted to file evidence and she also had a chance to give oral evidence at the General Division. In other words, if there were any procedural deficiencies by the Commission, in terms of disclosure and getting a chance to respond, the General Division corrected them.\nThe General Division did not make a legal error when it declined to decide whether the Claimant had been wrongfully dismissed [30] The General Division did not make a legal error when it declined to decide whether the Claimant had been wrongfully dismissed.\n[31] The Claimant argues that her employer wrongfully dismissed her as she was on a medical leave of absence. The Claimant went on a medical leave of absence on September 29, 2021.Footnote 10 Her employer expected her to return to work,Footnote 11 but she says that she had yet to receive a medical clearance to return to work. She notes that she had a follow-up consultation with her physician on January 11, 2022.\n[32] As the General Division noted, it did not have any authority to decide whether her employer wrongfully dismissed her. The General Division\u2019s determination on this point was consistent with the case law.Footnote 12 It did not make a legal error on this issue.\n[33] There are other avenues that the Claimant can pursue for wrongful dismissal. As the General Division noted, the Claimant has filed grievances against her employer.\nThe Appeal Division does not have the authority to examine whether the General Division properly weighed the evidence [34] The Appeal Division does not have the authority to examine whether the General Division properly weighed the evidence.\n[35] The Claimant argues that the General Division did not properly weigh the evidence. However, this matter falls outside the grounds of appeal under the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.\n[36] The assignment of weight is a matter properly for the province of the trier of fact, as it is in the best position to assess the evidence and to determine the appropriate amount of weight to assign. I cannot conclude that the General Division should have placed more weight on or given greater consideration to any evidence that favoured the Claimant.\nThe Claimant argues that the General Division overlooked some of the evidence relating to her medical fitness [37] The Claimant argues that the General Division overlooked the evidence. She denies that she committed any misconduct because she says she was not working and her doctor had not medically cleared for a return to work, She says the General Division overlooked this important consideration.\n[38] The General Division was alive to this issue and to the Claimant\u2019s arguments. The General Division noted that the Claimant and the employer disputed whether she was fit to return to work from a medical leave. The General Division noted that her employer assessed that the Claimant was fit and that it had stopped her disability income-replacement payments. The Claimant on the other hand denied that she was well enough to return to work.Footnote 13\n[39] The General Division accepted the Claimant\u2019s evidence about the dispute. The General Division noted that she had filed evidence of her labour grievances against her employer related to her medical leave and income replacement benefit.Footnote 14\n[40] But it is also clear that the General Division did not decide whether the Claimant was medically fit to return to work. It was outside the scope of the General Division\u2019s powers to examine whether the Claimant was medically fit to return to work and to assess whether her employer had justifiably dismissed her. The General Division appropriately determined the scope of its powers.\n[41] The General Division still had to determine whether there was any misconduct, despite the Claimant\u2019s dispute with her employer. It had to focus on whether the Claimant intentionally committed an act (or failed to commit an act) contrary to their employment obligations.Footnote 15\n[42] Clearly, the General Division accepted that the Claimant\u2019s employment obligations extended to being vaccinated and reporting her status, even if there was a dispute over her medical fitness to return to work. The General Division properly applied the test for misconduct and found that there was evidence to conclude that there was misconduct.\n[43] The issue regarding the Claimant\u2019s medical fitness to return to work\u2014likely tied in to whether she was wrongfully dismissed during a medical leave of absence\u2014can be addressed in another forum.\nThe General Division did not make a factual error about why the Claimant\u2019s employer dismissed her from her employment [44] The General Division did not make a factual error about why the Claimant\u2019s employer dismissed her from her employment. Contrary to what the Claimant says, the General Division said the Claimant was dismissed because she did not get fully vaccinated, not just simply that she failed to report her vaccination status. This was consistent with the evidence. The General Division came to this determination much later in its decision.\n[45] The Claimant argues that the General Division made an unsupported factual finding that she was dismissed for refusing to disclose her vaccination status.\n[46] The General Division found that it had to decide why the Claimant lost her job, and whether the Employment Insurance Act considered that reason to be misconduct.Footnote 16\n[47] The Claimant says the General Division found that she lost her job because she failed to report her vaccination status. But, she says that the evidence shows that she had in fact reported her vaccination status. So, if she had reported her vaccination status, then she could not possibly have committed misconduct.\n[48] The General Division discussed why the Claimant lost her job.Footnote 17 It did this under the heading, \u201cThe reason the [Claimant] lost her job.\u201d The General Division found that the Claimant\u2019s employer dismissed her because she had not complied with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy. In particular, it found that she had not reported her COVID vaccination status, which she was required to do under her employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[49] If the General Division had concluded that failure to report was the sole reason for the Claimant\u2019s dismissal, I would have determined that it had made a factual error.\n[50] The evidence shows that the employer expected the Claimant not only to report her status, but also to get vaccinated and to report that she was vaccinated.Footnote 18 Otherwise, she would be non-compliant with the employer\u2019s vaccination policy. But the General Division did not explain this vaccination requirement under its heading, \u201cThe reason the [Claimant] lost her job.\u201d It would have been helpful had it set this explanation out under this heading.\n[51] Instead, the General Division described the extent of the Claimant\u2019s employment obligations much later on in its decision, under the heading, \u201cThe Commission has proven misconduct under the EI Act.\u201d\n[52] The employer dismissed the Claimant because she had not fully complied with its updated policy. Under the updated policy, she was to be fully vaccinated and then report that she had gotten vaccinated. The General Division found that the Commission had proven misconduct as the evidence showed that the Claimant knew or should have known that, under her employer\u2019s vaccination policy, she had a duty to get fully vaccinated and to report her (updated) vaccination status, but chose not to comply.\n[53] In other words, it is clear that the General Division determined that the Claimant had been non-compliant with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy because she did not get vaccinated and then report that she was vaccinated, and that this was the basis for her dismissal from her employment. This was consistent with the evidence.\n[54] The Claimant denies that she was unprepared to get vaccinated but says that she wanted to make an informed decision. However, this does not mean that she was compliant with her employer\u2019s policy. And besides, as the General Division determined, the evidence suggested that the Claimant did not intend to get vaccinated, in light of her concerns about COVID vaccines.\n[55] There is one further point to address on this matter. The evidence does not include the actual notice of termination to confirm the basis for the Claimant\u2019s dismissal.\n[56] Ostensibly, it appears that the employer reported to the Commission that it had dismissed the Claimant for failing to disclose her vaccination status. But it also seems from its communications with the Claimant and its employees that it contemplated that reporting necessarily included vaccination. In other words, the employer dismissed the Claimant because she had not reported that she was fully vaccinated.\n[57] There is some conflicting evidence from the Claimant about what she understood was the reason for her dismissal.\n[58] There is some evidence where she stated that she believed her employer dismissed her because it mistakenly believed that she had not reported her status at any time. But, there is also evidence that the Claimant stated that she understood that her employer dismissed her for not getting vaccinated and for not reporting that she was vaccinated:\nin her Application for Employment Insurance benefits, the Claimant stated that the employer\u2019s vaccination policy required that all employees had to declare their status and be injected with the COVID injection by a specific date.Footnote 19 when the Claimant spoke with the Commission, she advised that her employer terminated her because she had not provided proof of vaccination.Footnote 20\n[59] The Claimant went to some effort to persuade her employer that she should be exempt from vaccination over safety and efficacy concerns. She served a Notice of Potential Liability and Notice to Produce. This suggests that she was aware that reporting her status, on its own, was insufficient to comply with her employer\u2019s requirements and to maintain her employment. It is unlikely that she would have gone to this extent if she believed that reporting on her status was enough to comply with her employer\u2019s obligations.\n[60] Finally, the employer\u2019s warning letter of notice of termination dated December 29, 2021 made it clear that the Claimant needed to be vaccinated, otherwise she would be subject to further disciplinary measures, up to and including dismissal.Footnote 21\n[61] The General Division was entitled to prefer the Claimant\u2019s evidence showing that she understood that her employer dismissed her for not providing proof of vaccination. This evidence was consistent with the Claimant\u2019s overall actions explaining why she did not get vaccinated.\nThe General Division misread the evidence [62] The General Division misread the evidence. It found that a particular sentence in the employer\u2019s warning letter of notice of termination of December 29, 2021, imposed an ongoing obligation on the Claimant to continue to report her vaccination status.\n[63] There was other evidence that required the Claimant to update her vaccination status after getting a first and second vaccine dose. However, the sentence in the December 29, 2021, letter did not impose any similar reporting obligation.\n[64] The sentence in the letter reads:\nFurther to the letter issued to you on December 23, 2021, this letter will serve to provide you with notice that should you fail to report your COVID-19 vaccination status by tomorrow December 30, 2021 at 12:00 pm your employment \u2026 will be terminated with cause, effective December 31, 2021.Footnote 22\n[65] The Claimant sys that she understood that she would need to report her vaccination status by December 30, 2021. The Claimant had reported her status before September 16, 2021. She reported then that she had not undergone vaccination. From the Claimant\u2019s perspective, she had already met her employer\u2019s reporting requirements in September 2021.\n[66] The General Division noted the Claimant\u2019s argument that she met her duty to report her vaccination status to her employer. The General Division found that the Claimant regarded this as a one-time obligation. However, the General Division found, based on the sentence above, that the Claimant had, \u201can ongoing obligation to report her vaccination status\u201dFootnote 23 and that the notice \u201cclearly states she has to report her vaccination status at that time.\u201dFootnote 24\n[67] The Commission says that the General Division misstated the evidence on this point. The sentence clearly required the Claimant to report her vaccination by December 30, 2021, but it did not impose an ongoing obligation, nor state that she had to report her vaccination status again if she had previously reported her status.\nAlthough the General Division misread a sentence, it did not change the outcome [68] The General Division misread a sentence. The General Division\u2019s statement was technically correct that the Claimant had ongoing reporting obligations, but it relied on the wrong sentence. Although it relied on the wrong sentence, the balance of the evidence supported its conclusions that the Claimant had an ongoing obligation to report (that she was vaccinated).\n[69] The warning letter also stated that the employer had informed the Claimant that failure to report her vaccination status and proof of vaccination would result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of her employment. The General Division would have properly set out the Claimant\u2019s reporting requirements if it had provided this further context and not relied solely on the one sentence in the letter.\n[70] Other communications from the employer also confirmed the Claimant\u2019s duties to get vaccinated and to report the vaccination. In August 2021, the employer wrote to the Claimant, saying, \u201cPlease note, staff who are not vaccinated must also report. I realize many of us already reported over the past weeks \u2013 we must report again and this time we need to provide proof of vaccination.\u201dFootnote 25\n[71] Early on, the employer created some confusion over its requirements, but once it updated its policy in September 2021, it should have been clear by then that the reporting was connected to mandatory vaccination. Reporting on its own was insufficient to meet the employer\u2019s requirements. Employees had to get vaccinated.Footnote 26\nThe employer updated its vaccination and reporting requirements [72] The employer had updated its vaccination policy and with it, its reporting requirements. The employer stated that it had broadly communicated its updated requirements on October 7, 2021, and then directly to the Claimant on October 14, 2021.Footnote 27\n[73] Further, on October 29, 2021, the employer wrote to the Claimant by both email and regular mail.Footnote 28 The employer told the Claimant that she had until November 30, 2021, to show that she was fully vaccinated. The employer said that she would have to show that she had received both required doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. This required her to update her status: once after she had received a first dose and again, after she received a second dose.\n[74] The General Division correctly noted that there was an ongoing obligation for the Claimant to report her vaccination status, but this was tied to getting the first and second doses.\n[75] This context\u2014that the employer required employees to report their vaccination status after a first dose and again after a second dose\u2014was important in explaining the General Division\u2019s determination that the Claimant had an ongoing obligation to report her vaccination status. The General Division did not provide this context, and referred solely to the one sentence in the letter of notice of termination.\n[76] The employer also advised the Claimant that failure to provide proof of vaccination by November 30, 2021 would result in her being deemed not fully vaccinated and non-compliant with the updated policy requirement.\n[77] Finally, the employer also advised that those who were non-compliant with its mandatory vaccination policy would be subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including dismissal.Footnote 29\n[78] In an exchange of email with the Claimant on December 21, 2021, the employer also confirmed that before she could return from sick leave, she would have to \u201csubmit [her] vaccination status and proof of vaccination immediately\u201d (My emphasis).Footnote 30\n[79] The employer wrote to the Claimant again later that same day. The employer advised her that the employer expected her to comply with the employer\u2019s policy and submit her vaccination status and proof of vaccination before returning to work on December 24, 2021.Footnote 31\nThe Claimant did not fully comply with her employer\u2019s updated requirements [80] So, although the Claimant had reported her vaccination status early on, this was insufficient to preserve her employment. The letter of October 29, 2021, emails of December 21, 2021, and warning letter of December 29, 2021, stressed that she had to report her vaccination status and get vaccinated.\n[81] The warning letter also said:\nAs communicated on October 7, 2021, effective November 30, 2021, [the employer] requires all staff and physicians to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, subject only to limited exemptions. Notwithstanding the above, should [she] report [her] status by December 30 at 12:00 PM, if [she was] not in compliance with Section 4.3 of the COVID-19 Vaccination Management Policy which requires mandatory vaccination, [she would] also be subject to further disciplinary measures, up to and including dismissal.Footnote 32\n[82] It was not enough for the Claimant to simply report on her vaccination status. The Claimant also had to show that she was fully vaccinated to avoid any disciplinary measures, including dismissal.\n[83] The General Division arguably may have misstated the evidence in finding that the sentence in the warning letter meant that she to report her vaccination status again by December 30, 2021. But it did not change the outcome as the Claimant also had to show that she was fully vaccinated. The Claimant knowingly did not meet this requirement of her employer\u2019s policy, while being aware of the consequences, which meant that she had committed misconduct.\nConclusion [84] The appeal is dismissed.\n[85] The evidence does not support the Claimant\u2019s arguments that she was fully compliant with her employer\u2019s updated vaccination policy. Reporting on her status alone was insufficient. She also had to provide proof of vaccination.\n[86] As the General Division determined, the Claimant knew or should have been aware of her employer\u2019s requirements and the consequences for non-compliance. The Claimant made a wilful and deliberate decision to not comply with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy. The Commission proved that there was misconduct under the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD) Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58(1)(c) of the DESD Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee Claimant's Supplementary Representations to the Social Security Tribunal-Employment Insurance section, at GD 10.\nFootnote 4\nSee Tribunal\u2019s letter dated February 2, 2023, at GD11.\nFootnote 5\nSee General Division decision, at para 12.\nFootnote 6\nSee General Division decision, at para 12.\nFootnote 7\nDigest of Benefit Entitlement Principles Chapter 7 - Section 2 - Canada.ca\nFootnote 8\nCanada (Attorney General) v Greey, 2009 FCA 296 at para 28.\nFootnote 9\nCanada (Attorney General) v Greey, 2009 FCA 296, at para 28, citing Silicon Graphics Ltd. v Canada (C.A.), 2002 FCA 250, [2003] 1 F.C. 447.\nFootnote 10\nSee Claimant's overview of facts, at AD 6-2, referring to physician's medical statement, at GD 8-4.\nFootnote 11\nSee Claimant's overview of facts, at AD 6-2.\nFootnote 12\nSee, for instance, Canada (Attorney General) v Caul, 2006 FCA 251.\nFootnote 13\nSee General Division decision, at para 20.\nFootnote 14\nSee General Division decision, at para 21, citing the grievance form at GD 7-18.\nFootnote 15\nThe Federal Court described the test for misconduct in Kuk v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1134 at para 37.\nFootnote 16\nSee General Division decision, at para 16.\nFootnote 17\nSee General Division decision, at paras 17 to 25.\nFootnote 18\nSee employer\u2019s emails of December 21, 2021, at GD 8-5\nFootnote 19\nSee Claimant\u2019s Application for Employment Insurance benefits, at GD 3-9.\nFootnote 20\nSee Supplementary Record of Claim dated May 17, 2022, at GD 3-41.

The appeal will not proceed.\nOverview [2] The Applicant, K. B. (Claimant), is asking for permission to appeal the General Division decision of October 13, 2023.\n[3] The General Division found that the Respondent, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) proved that the Claimant lost her job because of misconduct. In other words, she had done something that caused her to lose her job.\n[4] As a result of the misconduct, the Claimant was disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance benefits.\n[5] The Claimant denies that she committed any misconduct. She argues that the General Division made jurisdictional, legal, and factual errors when it concluded that she had committed misconduct.\n[6] Before the Claimant can move ahead with her appeal, I have to decide whether the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, there has to be an arguable case.Footnote 1 If the appeal does not have a reasonable chance of success, this ends the matter.Footnote 2\n[7] I am not satisfied that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. Therefore, I am not giving permission to the Claimant to move ahead with her appeal.\nIssues [8] The issues are as follows:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division failed to apply the Employment Standards Act or principles of labour law? b) Is there an arguable case that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means? c) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an important factual error?\nI am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [9] Leave to appeal is refused if the Appeal Division is satisfied that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success. A reasonable chance of success exists if the General Division may have made a jurisdictional, procedural, legal, or a certain type of factual error.Footnote 3\n[10] For this type of factual error, the General Division had to have based its decision on an error that it made in a perverse or capricious manner, or without regard for the evidence before it.Footnote 4\nThe Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division failed to apply the Employment Standards Act [11] The Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division failed to apply the Employment Standards Act or principles of labour law.\n[12] The Claimant says she is entitled to severance for wrongful dismissal. She says the Employment Standards Act and principles of labour law apply.\n[13] However, the Employment Standards Act and principles of labour law are irrelevant to whether a claimant has committed misconduct for the purposes of the Employment Insurance Act.\n[14] The courts have consistently stated that, in the context of the Employment Insurance scheme, principles of labour law and the Employment Standards Act do not apply. The courts have said that the role of the General Division is narrow when it comes to assessing misconduct. The General Division has to focus on whether the act or omission of an employee amounts to misconduct within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act.Footnote 5\n[15] There are other avenues outside the Employment Insurance setting that employees can pursue for any violations of any labour laws or the Employment Standards Act, including for wrongful dismissal.\nThe Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means [16] The Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means.\n[17] The Claimant denies that she committed any misconduct. The Claimant argues that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means. She says that misconduct does not arise in the following circumstances:\nIf an employee is able to fulfill their job duties without having to get vaccinated. The Claimant says that the employer\u2019s vaccination requirements were unrelated to her work. She says that she was still able to perform her job without having to get vaccinated. When the employer\u2019s policy is unlawful, unconstitutional, or unreasonable. She says an employee should not be required to have to comply with an unlawful or unreasonable policy. She says that her employer was requiring her to do something highly personal against her body. When an employer can accommodate an employee. The Claimant says her employer\u2019s policy was draconian. She says her employer should have accommodated her, rather than expect her to do something with which she did not agree.\nMisconduct can arise even if the employer introduces a new policy that is not part of an employee\u2019s original employment contract or job description [18] The Claimant says that vaccination was not part of her job duties. In essence, she says that her job duties were defined by her original contract and job description. She claims that if her employment contract and job description did not require vaccination, then she says there was no misconduct if she chose not to get vaccinated.\n[19] However, it has become well established that an employer\u2019s policies and requirements do not have to form part of the employment contract or job description for there to be misconduct.\n[20] Over the past year, the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal have issued several cases involving employees who did not comply with their respective employer\u2019s vaccination policies. In each case, none of the original employment contracts or job descriptions required vaccination against COVID-19. Yet, the courts were prepared to accept that there had been misconduct when the employees did not comply with their employer\u2019s vaccination policies.\n[21] For instance, in Matti, the Federal Court determined that it was unnecessary for the employer\u2019s vaccination policy to be in the initial agreement, as \u201cmisconduct can be assessed in relation to policies that arise after the employment relationship begins.\u201dFootnote 6\n[22] In the case of Kuk,Footnote 7 Mr. Kuk chose not to comply with his employer\u2019s vaccination policy. The policy did not form part of his employment contract. The Federal Court found that there was misconduct because Mr. Kuk knowingly did not comply with his employer\u2019s vaccination policy and knew what the consequences would be if he did not comply.\n[23] In CecchettoFootnote 8and in Milovac,Footnote 9 vaccination was not part of the collective agreement or contract of employment in those cases. The Federal Court found that, even so, there was misconduct when the appellants did not comply with their employer\u2019s vaccination policies.\n[24] There are also many cases outside of the context of vaccination policies that show that an employer\u2019s policies do not have to form part of the employment contract or a claimant\u2019s job description for there to be misconduct.Footnote 10 The vaccination policy introduced another requirement or duty that the employer expected of the Claimant.\nThe legality or reasonableness of a policy is irrelevant to the misconduct question [25] The Claimant says that her employer\u2019s vaccination policy was unlawful, unconstitutional, and unreasonable. For instance, she says her employer violated the Occupational Health and Safety Act with its vaccination policy. So, for that reason, she says that she did not have to comply with the policy.\n[26] She says the General Division should have examined the legality and reasonableness of the policy. She says that, if it had done so, it would have concluded that her employer\u2019s policy was both unlawful and unreasonable. And, for that reason, she says that it would have determined that she did not have to comply with the policy.\n[27] However, arguments about the legality and reasonableness of an employer\u2019s vaccination policy are irrelevant to the misconduct issue. The Federal Court has held that the General Division and the Appeal Division do not have the authority to address these types of arguments. In Cecchetto, the Court wrote:\nAs noted earlier, it is likely that the Applicant [Cecchetto] will find this result frustrating, because my reasons do not deal with the fundamental legal, ethical, and factual questions he is raising. That is because many of these questions are simply beyond the scope of this case. It is not unreasonable for a decision-maker to fail to address legal arguments that fall outside the scope of its legal mandate.\nThe SST-GD [Social Security Tribunal-General Division], and the Appeal Division, have an important, but narrow and specific role to play in the legal system. In this case, the role involved determining why the Applicant [Cecchetto] was dismissed from his employment, and whether that reason constituted \u201cmisconduct.\u201d\u2026\nDespite the Claimant\u2019s arguments, there is no basis to overturn the Appeal Division\u2019s decision because of its failure to assess or rule on the merits, legitimacy, or legality of Directive 6. That sort of finding was not within the mandate or jurisdiction of the Appeal Division, nor the SSTGD. [Citation omitted]Footnote 11\n(My emphasis)\n[28] The Federal Court has held that the General Division and Appeal Division, \u201care not the appropriate fora to determine whether the [employer\u2019s] policy or [the employee\u2019s] termination were reasonable.\u201dFootnote 12\n[29] I am not satisfied that there is an arguable case that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means when it did not assess the legality or reasonableness of the employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\nAn employer\u2019s lack of accommodation is irrelevant to the misconduct question [30] The Claimant argues that her employer could have accommodated her, rather than dismissing her for not getting vaccinated.\n[31] However, the Federal Court of Appeal has found that an employer\u2019s duty to accommodate is irrelevant to whether there is misconduct under the Employment Insurance Act.Footnote 13\n[32] I am not satisfied that there is an arguable case that the General Division misinterpreted what misconduct means if it did not assess whether the Claimant\u2019s employer could have accommodated instead of dismissing her.\nThe Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division made important factual errors [33] The Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division made important factual errors about whether she should have been aware of the consequences for not complying with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[34] The Claimant says the General Division made a factual error when it found that she was aware that her employer would dismiss her if she did not comply with its policy. She denies that she knew that her employer could dismiss her.\n[35] The General Division wrote:\n.. the [Claimant] confirmed she was aware that if she didn\u2019t comply with the employer\u2019s vaccination policy she would be dismissed (GD3-31).Footnote 14\n[36] The General Division identified the evidence that showed the Claimant was aware that she faced dismissal.\n[37] The General Division\u2019s findings are consistent with the evidence. In addition to the Commission\u2019s Supplementary Record of Claim (GD3-31), the Claimant\u2019s employer also reported to the Commission that it had informed the Claimant of its vaccination requirements. The employer reportedly told the Claimant that it would dismiss her from her employment if she did not comply with its vaccination policy.Footnote 15\n[38] I find that the Claimant does not have an arguable case that the General Division made a factual error about whether she was aware that she could face dismissal for not complying with her employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\nConclusion [39] Permission to appeal is refused.

H., is eligible for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension. Payments start as of November 2020. This decision explains why I am allowing the appeal.\nOverview [3] The Appellant is 50 years old. Her only paying jobs have been as a labourer in factories. In 2006 she started to develop pain in her shoulders, wrists, hand, right hip, knees, ankles, and feet. As a result, she stopped working for periods of time. In 2016 she was diagnosed with active rheumatoid arthritis. Again, she took time off as needed. Her last job was as a \u201cMerchandise Handler\u201d (or packer) for a clothing company. She had that job from September 2016 to June 2020, when she left the job because of pain and other limitations. She says she hasn\u2019t been able to work since because of the limitations caused by rheumatoid arthritis.\n[4] The Appellant applied for a CPP disability pension on October 26, 2021. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused her application. The Appellant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s General Division.\n[5] The Appellant says that her rheumatoid arthritis flare up has continued since June 2020. She says because of that, she cannot work in any job and often struggles to take care of her own personal needs. She said she doesn\u2019t like not working and would go back to work if her symptoms improved.\n[6] The Minister says that the Appellant\u2019s disability isn\u2019t severe because she is capable regularly of some work. The Minister also says that her specialist thinks her rheumatoid arthritis will settle into remission \u201cthus allowing her to return to work.\u201d\nWhat the Appellant must prove [7] For the Appellant to succeed, she must prove she has a disability that was severe and prolonged by December 31, 2023. In other words, no later than December 31, 2023. This date is based on her CPP contributions.Footnote 1 She must also prove that she continues to be disabled.Footnote 2\n[8] The Canada Pension Plan defines \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cprolonged.\u201d\n[9] A disability is severe if it makes an appellant incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation.Footnote 3\n[10] This means I have to look at all of the Appellant\u2019s medical conditions together to see what effect they have on her ability to work. I also have to look at her background (including her age, level of education, and past work and life experience). This is so I can get a realistic or \u201creal world\u201d picture of whether her disability is severe. If the Appellant is capable regularly of doing some kind of work that she could earn a living from, then she isn\u2019t entitled to a disability pension.\n[11] A disability is prolonged if it is likely to be long continued and of indefinite duration, or is likely to result in death.Footnote 4\n[12] This means the Appellant\u2019s disability can\u2019t have an expected recovery date. The disability must be expected to keep the Appellant out of the workforce for a long time.\n[13] The Appellant has to prove she has a severe and prolonged disability. She has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means she has to show it is more likely than not that she is disabled.\nReasons for my decision [14] I find that the Appellant had a severe and prolonged disability as of June 2020. She continues to be disabled. I reached this decision by considering the following issues:\nWas the Appellant\u2019s disability severe? Was the Appellant\u2019s disability prolonged?\nWas the Appellant\u2019s disability severe? [15] The Appellant\u2019s disability was continuously severe. I reached this finding by considering several factors. I explain these factors below.\nThe Appellant\u2019s functional limitations affected her ability to work [16] The Appellant has active rheumatoid arthritis. She has other conditions I will talk about more later. However, I can\u2019t focus on the Appellant\u2019s diagnoses.Footnote 5 Instead, I must focus on whether she has functional limitations that got in the way of her earning a living.Footnote 6 When I do this, I have to look at all of the Appellant\u2019s medical conditions (not just the main one) and think about how they affected her ability to work.Footnote 7\n[17] I find that the Appellant has functional limitations that affected her ability to work.\nWhat the Appellant says about her functional limitations [18] The Appellant says that her medical conditions have resulted in functional limitations that affect her ability to work.\n[19] I believe what the Appellant says about her functional limitations and that if she could work, she would. The medical evidence shows that the Appellant worked for many years after her symptoms started. Before she stopped working completely in June 2020, she had periods of flare-ups of pain, swelling and numbness in her joints. She also had periods of remission or milder flare-ups. The periods she worked and didn\u2019t work match with the description of her condition and symptoms in the medical evidence.\n[20] The Appellant says that since she stopped working in June 2020, her rheumatoid arthritis flares up regularly and because of that:Footnote 8\nSometimes she cannot get out of bed. Her right-hand hurts so much and so often that sometimes she cannot clean herself without help. Sometimes, her younger kids who are 12, cannot go to school because they have to stay home and take care of her. She has chronic pain, swelling and\/or numbness in her shoulders, arms, right hand, neck, ankles, knees.\n[21] At the hearing the Appellant said some symptoms have gotten worse since she stopped working in June 2020. She says that before, her right hand gave her problems. No, she has trouble with both hands because of carpal tunnel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. She has to wear hand-splints at night. She says she cannot open her pill bottles.\n[22] The Appellant also said that if she walks too much, her right ankle swells and for a couple days after she cannot stand or walk and has to rest.\n[23] The Appellant has tendonitis in her shoulders and a disc in her neck swells periodically because of the rheumatoid arthritis. If she uses her right shoulder too much, the next day she cannot use her right arm and has to use her left only.\nWhat the medical evidence says about the Appellant\u2019s functional limitations [24] The Appellant must provide some medical evidence that supports that her functional limitations affected her ability to work no later than December 31, 2023.Footnote 9 As I mentioned earlier, the medical evidence supports what the Appellant says. I will no set out the details of the medical evidence.\n[25] In June 2016 as ultrasound of her left shoulder showed that she had supraspinatus and subscapularis tendinosis.Footnote 10\n[26] In July 2016 she had her first visit with a rheumatologist. He noted that her joint pain started in 2006 and had been severe for the past month. He also said that starting in November 2015 she developed recurrent pain in her shoulders, wrists, hands, right hip, knees, ankles, and feet. He said she would get episodes of severe pain weekly that lasted 2 to 3 days. He also said that symptoms got worse with overactivity. He said she likely had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and started her on medications.Footnote 11\n[27] Between 2016 and 2020, the Appellant worked because her rheumatoid arthritis when into periods of remission or she only had mild flare-ups.Footnote 12 She took time off when she needed. However, in January 2020 her rheumatoid arthritis became active again with inflammation in her right hand, neck, knees, ankles and occasionally her elbows. She was stiff for up to an hour in the morning.Footnote 13\n[28] Since January 2020, her symptoms have been consistently bad.Footnote 14 The medical report form completed by her family doctor says that as a result of her impairments from rheumatoid arthritis she cannot walk or stand for prolonged periods and has difficulty with bathing and dressing.Footnote 15\n[29] Next, I will look at whether the Appellant followed medical advice.\nThe Appellant followed medical advice [30] To receive a disability pension, an appellant must follow medical advice.Footnote 16 The Appellant followed medical advice.Footnote 17 The Minister doesn\u2019t argue otherwise, and the evidence is clear that she has followed medical advice.\n[31] I now have to decide whether the Appellant can regularly do other types of work. To be severe, the Appellant\u2019s functional limitations must prevent her from earning a living at any type of work, not just her usual job.Footnote 18\nThe Appellant can\u2019t work in the real world [32] When I am deciding whether the Appellant can work, I can\u2019t just look at her medical conditions and how they affect what she can do. I must also consider factors such as her:\nage level of education language abilities past work and life experience\n[33] These factors help me decide whether the Appellant can work in the real world\u2014in other words, whether it is realistic to say that she can work.Footnote 19 I find that the Appellant can\u2019t work in the real world. The Appellant hasn\u2019t been able to work since June 2020.\n[34] The Appellant is 50 and therefore has several years before the standard age of retirement. She speaks English fluently. She also has a college diploma as a dental assistant in 1994, but she never worked in a paying job in that field. She said that she tried to get volunteer experience as a dental assistant, but she had problems with her hands doing that job.\n[35] The Appellant\u2019s only paying work experience has been in factories. She has never had an office job. I find that she isn\u2019t even physically capable of retraining and getting an office job. Her limitations are too severe and frequent to make her regularly capable of doing office work or retraining. She regularly cannot get out of bed, dress, and handle her daily hygiene without help. Because of the pain and swelling in her hands, due to rheumatoid arthritis and now carpal tunnel syndrome, she couldn\u2019t use a computer.\n[36] I find that the Appellant\u2019s disability was severe as of June 2020.\nWas the Appellant\u2019s disability prolonged? [37] The Appellant\u2019s disability was prolonged.\n[38] The Appellant\u2019s primary condition, rheumatoid arthritis, was first diagnosed in July 2016 but symptoms started, to varying degrees, before that. Since being diagnosed there were periods of remission or milder flare-ups when she was able to work. However, since she stopped working in June 2020, she hasn\u2019t been able to work. This is clear from the medical evidence and what the Appellant says. It has therefore been over three years since she has been continuously disabled.\n[39] The Minister says that with ongoing optimal treatment her rheumatologist felt her condition would settle into remission once again. The medical evidence does not support what the Minister says.\n[40] The Appellant may go into some degree of partial or substantial remission. That doesn\u2019t mean her disability will get better enough so she is regularly capable of working. It also isn\u2019t something that is likely to happen in the foreseeable future. Her disability is long continued and of indefinite duration.\n[41] I find that the Appellant\u2019s disability was prolonged as of June 2020.\nWhen payments start [42] The Appellant had a severe and prolonged disability in June 2020.\n[43] However, the Canada Pension Plan says a person can\u2019t be considered disabled more than 15 months before the Minister receives their disability pension application.Footnote 20 After that, there is a 4-month waiting period before payments start.Footnote 21\n[44] The Minister received the Appellant\u2019s application in October 2021. That means she is considered to have become disabled in July 2020.\n[45] Her pension payments start as of November 2020.\nConclusion [46] I find that the Appellant is eligible for a CPP disability pension because her disability was severe and prolonged.\n[47] This means the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nService Canada uses an appellant\u2019s years of CPP contributions to calculate their coverage period, or \u201cminimum qualifying period\u201d (MQP). The end of the coverage period is called the MQP date. See section 44(2) of the Canada Pension Plan. The Appellant\u2019s CPP contributions are on GD2-6.\nFootnote 2\nIn Canada (Attorney General) v Angell, 2020 FC 1093, the Federal Court said that the appellant has to show a severe and prolonged disability by the end of their minimum qualifying period and continuously after that. See also Brennan v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 318.\nFootnote 3\nSection 42(2)(a) of the Canada Pension Plan gives this definition of severe disability. Section 68.1 of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations says a job is \u201csubstantially gainful\u201d if it pays a salary or wages equal to or greater than the maximum annual amount a person could receive as a disability pension.\nFootnote 4\nSection 42(2)(a) of the Canada Pension Plan gives this definition of prolonged disability.\nFootnote 5\nSee Ferreira v Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FCA 81.\nFootnote 6\nSee Klabouch v Canada (Social Development), 2008 FCA 33.\nFootnote 7\nSee Bungay v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 47.\nFootnote 8\nSee GD1, GD2-17 and GD2-144\nFootnote 9\nSee Warren v Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 377; and Canada (Attorney General) v Dean, 2020 FC 206.\nFootnote 10\nSee GD2-137.\nFootnote 11\nSee GD2-106 and GD2-107.\nFootnote 12\nSee GD2-98 to GD2-102.\nFootnote 13\nSee GD2-96 and GD2-97.\nFootnote 14\nSee GD2-69 to GD2-71, GD2-75 to GD2-78, GD2-109 to GD2-113, GD3 and GD4-4.\nFootnote 15\nSee GD2-79 to GD2-87.\nFootnote 16\nSee Sharma v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 48.\nFootnote 17\nSee Sharma v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 48.\nFootnote 18\nSee Klabouch v Canada (Social Development), 2008 FCA 33.\nFootnote 19\nSee Villani v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 248.\nFootnote 20\nSection 42(2)(b) of the Canada Pension Plan sets out this rule.\nFootnote 21\nSection 69 of the Canada Pension Plan sets out this rule. This means that payments can\u2019t start more than 11 months before the application date.\n",

L.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (0) dated November 2, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Marc St-Jules\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: December 18, 2023\nHearing participant: Appellant\nDecision date: January 5, 2023\nCORRIGENDUM DATE: January 10, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-3077\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Matters I have to consider first Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] I am dismissing the appeal with modification. The Tribunal disagrees in part with the Appellant.Footnote 1\n[2] In this appeal the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) has not proven that the Appellant's employer placed him on unpaid leave because of misconduct.\n[3] In this appeal, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission has proven that the employer terminated his employment in April 2022 because of misconduct. In other words, because he did something that caused him to be dismissed from his job.\n[4] This means that the Appellant isn\u2019t entitled to receive Employment Insurance (EI) following his dismissal. This is what the Commission decided. In other words, the Commission made the correct decision in his EI claim.\nOverview [5] His employer put him on an involuntary unpaid leave of absence starting November 1, 2021. The employer then dismissed him effective April 22, 2022. The Commission is saying the employer put him on leave and dismissed him because he didn\u2019t follow its mandatory COVID vaccination policy (vaccination policy).\n[6] The Commission decided that the Appellant was suspended and dismissed from his job for a reason the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) considers to be misconduct. Because of this, the Commission was unable to pay him EI benefits starting June 5, 2022.Footnote 2\n[7] I have to decide whether the Appellant was suspended then dismissed from his job for misconduct under the EI Act.\nMatters I have to consider first The Appellant\u2019s appeal was returned to the General Division [8] The Appellant first appealed to the General Division in June 2023. This was concerning a reconsideration decision dated October 12, 2022. Appellants have 30 days after which they were communicated a decision to file an appeal.Footnote 3 The Tribunal, however, has the authority to allow more time (up to a year) when an explanation is found to be acceptable.Footnote 4\n[9] The General Division reviewed the reasons the Appellant provided and did not accept his late appeal. The Appellant then made a request to the Appeal Division.\n[10] The Appeal Division member found that the Appellant did provide an acceptable reason for the delay. The Member ordered the appeal to be returned to the General Division for a hearing.\n[11] This decision is the result of that hearing.\nThe Tribunal does not accept links or attachments via online shared folders or web links [12] On December 7, 2023, the Appellant shared a link to a tweet. He also included a link to a Google drive which would include a contract that the government would have signed agreeing to purchase vaccines.\n[13] In response to this, the Tribunal replied to the Appellant on December 7, 2023. The reply says that the Tribunal does not accept links or attachments via online shared folders or web links.Footnote 5\n[14] This was discussed during the hearing. The Appellant acknowledged that he had received the notice that links or online shared documents are not permissible.\n[15] The Appellant did not raise a concern with this during the hearing.\n[16] The Appellant was given an opportunity to provide additional submissions in an acceptable format via the email dated December 7, 2023. He was also given an opportunity at the start of the hearing. The Appellant declined to submit anything more.\n[17] The Appellant did speak about this evidence during the hearing. I have no reason to doubt what the links contained. As explained in this decision, the Appellant has proven himself to be credible. I therefore considered the evidence the Appellant provided verbally during the hearing.\nIssue [18] Was the Appellant suspended then dismissed and was it misconduct under the EI Act?\nAnalysis [19] The law says that you can\u2019t get EI benefits if you lose your job because of misconduct. This applies when the employer has let you go or suspended you.\n[20] I have to decide two things:\nThe reason the Appellant was suspended then terminated from his job. Whether the EI Act considers that reason to be misconduct.\n[21] An employee who loses their job due to \u201cmisconduct\u201d is not entitled to receive EI benefits; the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d in this context refers to the employee\u2019s violation of an employment rule.\nThe reason the Appellant was suspended then terminated or dismissed [22] I find the Appellant\u2019s employer suspended and dismissed him because he didn\u2019t comply with its vaccination policy.\n[23] The Appellant and the Commission agree that the Appellant was suspended on November 1, 2021. They also agree that the Appellant was then terminated on April 22, 2022. The reason was non-compliance with the new mandatory vaccine policy. The parties do not agree on the misconduct part.\n[24] I have no reason to believe any other reason why the Appellant is no longer working. There is nothing in the file or in testimony to make me doubt this finding. Based on the evidence before me, I find non-compliance with the vaccination policy as the reason the Appellant is no longer working with the employer.\nIs the reason misconduct under the law? [25] I find that the unpaid leave of absence is not misconduct under the EI Act. I find that the Appellant\u2019s dismissal or termination is misconduct under the EI Act. My analysis is in the following paragraphs.\nWhat misconduct means under the EI Act [26] The EI Actdoesn\u2019t say what misconduct means. Court decisions set out the legal test for misconduct. The legal test tells me the types of facts and the issues I have to consider when making my decision.\n[27] The Commission has to prove it\u2019s more likely than not he was dismissed from his job because of misconduct, and not for another reason.Footnote 6\n[28] I have to focus on what the Appellant did or failed to do, and whether that conduct amounts to misconduct under the EI Act.Footnote 7 I can\u2019t consider whether the employer\u2019s policy is reasonable, or whether a suspension or termination was a reasonable consequence.Footnote 8\n[29] The Appellant doesn\u2019t have to have wrongful intent. In other words, he doesn\u2019t have to mean to do something wrong for me to decide his conduct is misconduct.Footnote 9 To be misconduct, his conduct has to be wilful, meaning conscious, deliberate, or intentional.Footnote 10 And misconduct also includes conduct that is so reckless that it is almost wilful.Footnote 11\n[30] There is misconduct if the Appellant knew or should have known his conduct could get in the way of carrying out his duties toward his employer and knew or should have known there was a real possibility of being let go because of that.Footnote 12\n[31] I can only decide whether there was misconduct under the EI Act. I can\u2019t make my decision based on other laws.Footnote 13 I can\u2019t decide whether the Appellant was constructively or wrongfully dismissed under employment law. I can\u2019t interpret an employment contract or decide whether an employer breached a collective agreement.Footnote 14 I also can\u2019t decide whether an employer discriminated against the Appellant or should have accommodated them under human rights law.Footnote 15 And I can\u2019t decide whether an employer breached the Appellant\u2019s privacy or other rights in the employment context, or otherwise.\nWhat the Commission and the Appellant say [32] The Commission says that there was misconduct under the EI Act because the evidence shows\nThe employer had a vaccination policy and communicated that policy to all staff. Under the vaccination policy, all employees needed to comply with the policy or face suspension and possible dismissal. Employees who did not want to be vaccinated needed to submit an exemption request and have this request accepted by the employer. The Appellant knew what he had to do under the policy. He also knew his employer could put him on unpaid leave or dismiss him for non-compliance with the policy. The employer first suspended the Appellant without pay then dismissed him effective April 22, 2022, because he didn\u2019t comply with its vaccination policy.\n[33] The Appellant says there was no misconduct under the EI Act because of the following:\nThe Appellant had submitted a vaccine exemption request on September 19, 2021.Footnote 16 He was originally denied on September 28, 2021.Footnote 17 He supplied additional information on October 4, 2021.Footnote 18 He was suspended on November 1, 2021.Footnote 19 His exemption was still under review. He argues he was still complying as of November 1, 2021. He was denied the exemption request on November 8, 2021.Footnote 20 The problem is that he was already suspended without pay. The government acknowledged when purchasing vaccines that the long-term effects and efficacy are not currently known.Footnote 21 How can the government then assist employers by denying benefits on an unproven vaccine? Others were granted benefits. He referenced a Tweet from someone winning n appeal.Footnote 22 The Appellant also argues that he was dismissed in April 2022 and the employer agreed that it was without cause.\n[34] The evidence in this appeal is consistent and straightforward. I believe and accept the Appellant\u2019s evidence and the Commission\u2019s evidence.\n[35] I have no reason to doubt the Appellant\u2019s evidence (what he said to the Commission, wrote in his reconsideration request and appeal notice, and his testimony at the hearing). His evidence is consistent. And there is no evidence that contradicts what he said.\n[36] I accept the Commission\u2019s evidence because it\u2019s consistent with the Appellant\u2019s evidence. In this case, there is no dispute in the evidence. As a Tribunal member, I must rule on the balance of probabilities. The evidence is clear in this case. The parties agree on the facts. I therefore accept the evidence as provided by both parties.\n[37] The test that needs to be met is the EI Act. This legal test is what the Tribunal needs to review. The Commission has proven that the Appellant was advised of the policy, knew the consequences of non-compliance and followed through with his non-compliance knowing it could lead to his suspension and dismissal. His behaviour was wilful. His actions were conscious, deliberate, or intentional.\n[38] I find the Appellant had no wrongful intent. Nothing in the evidence suggests this. As mentioned above, for there to be misconduct, the test that needs to be met was wilfulness. There is no need to prove wrongful intent.\n[39] There have been more recent court cases which support this. In a recent case called Parmar,Footnote 23 the issue before the Court was whether an employer was allowed to place an employee on an unpaid leave of absence for failing to comply with a mandatory vaccination policy. Ms. Parmar objected to being vaccinated because she was concerned about the long-term efficacy and potential negative health implications.\n[40] The Court in that case recognized that it was \u201cextraordinary to enact policy that impacts an employee\u2019s bodily integrity\u201d but ruled that the vaccination policy in question was reasonable, given the \u201cextraordinary health challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d The Court then went on to say:\n[154]. . . [Mandatory vaccination policies] do not force an employee to be vaccinated. What they do force is a choice between getting vaccinated, and continuing to earn an income, or remaining unvaccinated, and losing their income \u2026\n[41] Jurisprudence has confirmed the Tribunal\u2019s limited jurisdiction as mentioned above. Another recent case from January 2023, the Federal Court agrees that the Tribunal has limited authority.Footnote 24 The case started with the Commission then went to the Tribunal\u2019s General Division. The Appeal division then upheld the decision. The Federal Court then reviewed the decision. Paragraph 32 has the following:\n[32] While the Applicant is clearly frustrated that none of the decision-makers have addressed what he sees as the fundamental legal or factual issues that he raises \u2013 for example regarding bodily integrity, consent to medical testing, the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines or antigen tests \u2013 that does not make the decision of the Appeal Division unreasonable. The key problem with the Applicant\u2019s argument is that he is criticizing decision-makers for failing to deal with a set of questions they are not, by law, permitted to address.\n[42] The Appellant argued that the government\u2019s acknowledgement that vaccines were not proven to be safe or effective should be considered. I do not agree. A recent Federal Court decision addressed this issue.Footnote 25 In that case, the applicant put forward that the vaccine was not proven to be safe or efficient.Footnote 26 I will call this decision Cecchetto.\n[43] In Cecchetto, the Federal Court confirmed the Appeal Division\u2019s decision that, by law, this Tribunal is not permitted to address these questions. The Court agreed that by making a personal and deliberate choice not to follow the employer\u2019s vaccination policy, the applicant had breached his duties and had lost his job because of misconduct under the EI Act. The Court stated that there exist other ways in which the claimant\u2019s claims can properly advance under the legal system.\n[44] Another Federal Court decision dealt with an individual who refused to be vaccinated.Footnote 27 The applicant in this case worked full time from home and had been denied an exemption under the Human Rights Code. This decision has the following to say in paragraph [32]:\n[32] Like in Cecchetto, this Applicant was aware of the consequences of non-compliance with the Policy in light of the multiple communications from the UHN explaining as such. The Applicant also had the opportunity to remedy his situation on multiple occasions. The Applicant was aware that his request for an exemption was denied. His voluntary decision not to comply with the Policy constituted voluntary misconduct in this context.\n[45] I therefore make no findings with respect to the validity of the policy or any violations of the Appellant\u2019s rights under other laws.\n[46] I agree the Appellant can decline vaccination. That is his own personal decision. This is his right. I also agree the employer has to manage the day-to-day operations of the workplace. This includes developing and applying policies related to health and safety in the workplace. The employer has a responsibility to provide a safe workplace.\n[47] I also cannot consider the fact that the employer says that he was not terminated for cause. The Appellant did not have any ill intent. I found nothing in the evidence before me to suggest otherwise. The test that must be met is the EI Act. According to the EI Act and case law, the Appellant met the criteria for misconduct under the EI Act.\nSuspension effective November 1, 2021 [48] Based on the evidence, I find that the Commission has not proven that the Appellant was suspended because of misconduct. In this case, the Appellant says he was aware of the policy. He knew he could be suspended if he did not comply.\n[49] The Appellant, however, says he was still in compliance with the policy. He had submitted an exemption request. He then supplied additional information within the required timeframe.\n[50] I reviewed the exemption denial letter.Footnote 28 It is dated September 28, 2021. It is clear that his exemption request was denied. The letter, however, mentions that the employer is not able to provide him an exemption at this time. The letter also informs the Appellant that he can submit further information within one week. The Appellant did submit additional information within one week as offered.Footnote 29 This is an email dated October 4, 2021.\n[51] The Appellant says that he was then suspended effective November 1, 2021. He testified this was a surprise to him. He was under the impression his request was still under review. He did not know he would be suspended.\n[52] I believe the Appellant. As mentioned above, I was given no reason to doubt any of his statements to the Commission. I also have no reason to doubt any of the testimony he provided during the hearing.\n[53] For this reason, I find that the element that he knew or ought to have known that he may be suspended is not met. For this reason, I find that the Appellant was not suspended because of misconduct.\n[54] Under the EI Act, suspensions may have an end date. Under section 31 of the EI Act, a claimant who is suspended from their employment because of misconduct is not entitled to receive benefits until\na) the period of suspension expires; b) the claimant loses or voluntarily leaves the employment; or c) the claimant, after the beginning of the period of suspension, accumulates with another employer the number of hours of insurable employment required by section 7 or 7.1 to qualify to receive benefits.\n[55] For this reason, the disentitlement that may have applied to the Appellant would end with his termination. In other words, section 31(b) of the EI Act would apply. However, in this case, I find that the Appellant would not have been subject to a disentitlement.\nTermination effective April 22, 2022 [56] Based on the evidence, I find that the Commission has proven the Appellant\u2019s termination was misconduct because it has shown that:\nHe knew that his employer could terminate his employment if he didn\u2019t comply with the policy. He knew that his exemption request had been denied. He consciously, deliberately, or intentionally made a personal decision not to comply. He was dismissed from his job because he didn\u2019t comply with his employer\u2019s vaccination policy.\n[57] The Appellant is arguing this is not misconduct. He is relying in part on the fact that the employer confirmed there was no cause for the termination. I agree that there was no ill intent on his part. However, the test that needs to be met is the EI Act.\n[58] The Appellant testified that he knew he could be dismissed if he did not comply with the policy. He also testified that he had read the November 8, 2021, letter advising him that his exemption request was denied. This letter clearly mentions that termination from employment is a possibility for individuals who do not comply.\n[59] Unlike the suspension, I find that for the termination, the Appellant knew or ought to have known that he would be terminated for non-compliance with the policy. It is in the policy that unvaccinated individuals without an exemption may be terminated. This is in the policy, and it is also found in the letter denying the exemption request. This letter is dated November 8, 2021.\n[60] I understand the Appellant may not agree with this decision. Even so, the Federal Court of Appeal dictates that I can only follow the plain meaning of the law. I can\u2019t rewrite the law or add new things to the law to make an outcome that seems fairer for the Appellant.Footnote 30\nConclusion [61] The Commission has not proven that the Appellant was suspended because of misconduct under the EI Act.\n[62] The Commission has proven that the Appellant was terminated because of misconduct effective April 22, 2022. This means the Appellant would be disqualified from this date. However, as the claim started June 5, 2022, the Commission correctly disqualified him from June 5, 2022.\n[63] This means the Commission made the correct decision in his EI claim.\n[1] So, I am dismissing his appeal.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nA person who applies for employment insurance (EI) benefits is called a \u201cClaimant.\u201d A person who appeals a decision of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) is called an \u201cAppellant.\u201d\nFootnote 2\nSee GD3 page 26.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 52(1)(a) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (DESD Act).\nFootnote 4\nSection 52(2) of the DESD Act says that the Social Security Tribunal may allow up to a year.

The appeal won\u2019t go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] C. L. (Claimant) applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension on September 22, 2022. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) approved the Claimant\u2019s application. The Claimant began receiving a monthly pension of $270.74 beginning in October 2022.\n[3] The Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider its decision because she thought her pension should be higher based on the years she has worked in Canada and the increasing cost of living. The Minister maintained its decision on reconsideration. The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal.\n[4] The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal, finding that the Minister calculated the Claimant\u2019s retirement pension by following the rules. The General Division saw no mistake in the Minister\u2019s calculations.\nIssues [5] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Could the General Division have made an error that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [6] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[7] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[8] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error. [9] The Claimant argues that the amount of her retirement pension is too low, and that she should be receiving somewhere between $550.00 and $800.00 per month in CPP retirement pension. The calculation she provided to support her position starts with something she calls her \u201cworking income estimate\u201d to which she added \u201cinterest,\u201d subtracted some type of \u201cincome tax\u201d and then added more \u201cinterest\u201d to arrive at $1,100,000.00.Footnote 3\n[10] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division.\n[11] The General Division reviewed the Minister\u2019s calculation of the retirement pension by:\ncalculating the Claimant\u2019s adjusted pensionable earnings; dividing the adjusted pensionable earnings by the number of months in her contributory period, to arrive at her average monthly pensionable earnings; dividing the monthly pensionable earnings by 25% to arrive at the monthly pension amount; and then reducing the pension based on her age (because she was not yet 65 when she applied).Footnote 4\n[12] I see no basis in law for the Claimant\u2019s approach to calculating the retirement pension payments. She has not shown an arguable case for an error by the General Division, which set out the calculation according to the CPP.Footnote 5\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division. [13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t presented any evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division, so that cannot form the basis for giving the Claimant permission to appeal.\n[14] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence about the Claimant\u2019s CPP retirement pension amount.Footnote 6\nConclusion [15] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not go ahead.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1-5.\nFootnote 4\nSee paragraph 9 and following in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 5\nSee section 46 of the Canada Pension Plan.\nFootnote 6\nFor more on that type of review by the Appeal Division, see Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

The appeal will not proceed. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] The Claimant turned 65 in September 2021. He applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement benefit. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) calculated his retirement pension payments based on 75% of his yearly wages prorated to October 1, 2021.\n[3] The Claimant asked for reconsideration, arguing that his monthly payments should be higher. The Minister didn\u2019t change its position, stating that the calculation was correct.\n[4] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed the appeal, finding that the Minister made no error in its calculations.\nIssues [5] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error of law about the Minister\u2019s calculation of the Claimant\u2019s retirement pension payments? b) Does the Claimant set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [6] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[7] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if their application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[8] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nNo arguable case for an error of law in the calculation. [9] At the Appeal Division, the Claimant argues that the General Division made an error of law by attributing 25% the maximum pensionable earnings for 2021 to his post-retirement benefit since he didn\u2019t make any contributions after September 30, 2021.Footnote 3\n[10] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error of law. The General Division must apply the law as it is written, and the law requires the Minister to collect the information about the Claimant\u2019s earnings for the year and then prorate them based on the date he retired.Footnote 4 Further, there\u2019s no arguable case the General Division made an error by stating that it\u2019s the Minister of National Revenue that determines the CPP contributions drawn from a person\u2019s pensionable earnings, not this Tribunal.Footnote 5\n[11] I see no argument here that the General Division made a mistake by finding that the Minister\u2019s calculations for the retirement and post-retirement benefit were correct.Footnote 6\n[12] I\u2019ve reviewed the record and I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence.Footnote 7\nNo new evidence [13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division, so that cannot form the basis for giving him permission to appeal.\nConclusion [14] I\u2019ve refused the Claimant permission to appeal.

Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. This means that the Claimant\u2019s appeal about when his Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension payments should start will not go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] S. N. (Claimant) was severely injured in the spring of 2015. He applied for a CPP disability pension on March 7, 2017. The Minister refused his application. The Claimant didn\u2019t ask for reconsideration.\n[3] On February 28, 2022, the Claimant applied for the disability pension again. This time, the Minister allowed the application, finding that he was eligible. However, the Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider because he wanted his payments to start earlier. The Minister did not change the decision.\n[4] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed his appeal, finding that the Claimant\u2019s payments start in March 2021.\nIssues [5] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Could the General Division have made an error of law in its decision about the start date for the Claimant\u2019s disability pension? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division that could justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal. [6] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[7] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[8] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence that could justify granting permission to appeal, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error of law about when the disability pension payments start. The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error of law by failing to provide him with payments starting when he first applied. [9] The Claimant argues that the General Division made an error about when his disability pension should have started. He argues that for the purpose of paying the disability pension, what matters is the following:\nHe has been disabled since 2015 when he was injured. He was also disabled in 2017 when he first applied for the disability pension, but the Minister made a mistake by refusing his application. He didn\u2019t have the means to appeal.Footnote 3\n[10] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error of law by failing to focus on the correct dates to calculate when his disability payments should start. It\u2019s not when the Claimant became disabled or when he first applied that matters when calculating the start date of his disability payments.\n[11] What matters is the date the Claimant applied the second time. The second application is the one that the Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider, and then the Minister issued a reconsideration letter for that application. Therefore, that is the only application that the General Division had the power to consider when deciding when payments start.Footnote 4\n[12] The General Division explained that the earliest claimants can be considered disabled for the purpose of payment is 15 months before they applied. Then there is a four-month waiting period before payments start. The Claimant applied in February 2022, 15 months before that application is November 2020. The waiting period ended four months later, so payments start March 2021.Footnote 5\n[13] I can understand the Claimant\u2019s logic about receiving payments that would start back when he first applied for the disability pension. However, there\u2019s no arguable case that General Division had the power to start his disability pension payments that early. The General Division had to follow the law by considering the application that was properly before it (the second one). The General Division considered the date he made the second application, and then found that his payments would start as early as the law allows, which is March 2021.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made any error about the Claimant\u2019s capacity to apply. [14] Disability pension payments can start sooner when claimants can show that they were incapable of forming or expressing the intention to apply earlier than they did.Footnote 6 In that case, for the purpose of payment, the General Division can consider the Claimant\u2019s application filed when he became incapable.\n[15] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made any error in its analysis about incapacity. He states only that he didn\u2019t have the means to appeal the first refusal from the Minister. The General Division relied on the available evidence and decided that while the Claimant\u2019s cognitive abilities did change after his May 2021 seizure, he was not incapable of forming or expressing an intention to apply.Footnote 7\n[16] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error of law so I cannot give him permission to appeal on that basis.\nThe new evidence isn\u2019t relevant to the issue on appeal. [17] In support of his application to the Appeal Division, the Claimant provided a new doctor\u2019s note dated December 19, 2023.Footnote 8 The note states that the Claimant is a good candidate for the disability pension, and that he is very limited in the amount of walking or standing he can do which makes him unable to get any jobs. It explains that the date of his accident was April 15, 2015.\n[18] The Claimant is already eligible for the CPP disability pension. The doctor\u2019s letter confirms when he became disabled. But nothing in that letter provides a basis for reaching a different conclusion about when the disability pension should start, according to the CPP. Since the new evidence isn\u2019t relevant to the issue on appeal about the start date for payments, it cannot form the basis for giving permission to appeal.\nConclusion [19] I\u2019ve refused the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal about when the Claimant\u2019s disability pension starts will not go ahead.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee sections 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1C-2 and 3 for that reconsideration decision. At AD1C-1, the Claimant argues that he didn\u2019t have the means to appeal that decision.\nFootnote 4\nSee section 82 in the CPP, which means that the General Division considers appeals from decisions the Minister makes on reconsideration. It is the Claimant\u2019s second application that has a reconsideration decision, so it is the Claimant\u2019s second application date that matters for calculating when the disability pension starts.\nFootnote 5\nSee paragraphs 9 and 10 in the General Division decision about when the disability pension starts based on section 42(2)(b) and section 69 of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).\nFootnote 6\nSee section 60(8) and (9) of the CPP and paragraphs 11 to 24 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 7\nSee paragraphs 23 and 24 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 8\nSee AD1D-2.\n",

T.\nRepresentative: B. V.\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated June 8, 2023 (GE-23-1131)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: December 14, 2023\nHearing participants:\nAppellant\u2019s representative Respondent Respondent\u2019s representative\nDecision date: January 15, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-667\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Remedy Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\nOverview [2] The Respondent (Claimant) applied for sickness benefits on November 8, 2022. A benefit period was established effective October 16, 2022.\n[3] When the Claimant applied for benefits, 15 weeks was the maximum allowed for sickness benefits. While he was receiving benefits, the provision of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) that sets out the maximum number of weeks for sickness benefits was amended. On December 18, 2022, the maximum became 26 weeks.\n[4] On March 20, 2023, the Appellant (Commission) told the Claimant that he was entitled to receive benefits for the maximum duration in place when he applied for benefits. So, it told him that he was entitled to 15 weeks of sickness benefits. The Claimant disagreed because he was still unable to go back to work because of his illness.\n[5] After reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[6] The General Division found that the Claimant applied for benefits before the EI Act was amended. It found that he was unable to work until April 15, 2023. It determined that the law was amended while he was receiving sickness benefits. As a result, he could receive benefits for 26 weeks.\n[7] The Commission was given permission to appeal. It argues that the General Division made an error of law.\n[8] I have to decide whether the General Division made an error when it found that the Claimant was entitled to 26 weeks of sickness benefits.\n[9] I am allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [10] Did the General Division make an error when it found that the Claimant was entitled to 26 weeks of sickness benefits?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [11] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[12] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[13] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, I must dismiss the appeal.\nDid the General Division make an error when it found that the Claimant was entitled to 26 weeks of sickness benefits? [14] The General Division found that the Claimant applied for benefits before the EI Act was amended. It found that he was unable to work until April 15, 2023. It determined that the law was amended while he was receiving sickness benefits. As a result, he could receive benefits for 26 weeks.\n[15] It is not disputed that the Claimant applied for sickness benefits before the amendment to the EI Act extending sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks.\n[16] The general rule is that statutes are not to be construed as having retroactive effect unless such a construction is expressly or by necessary implication required by the language of the law. Footnote 2\n[17] There is retroactive effect when a new statute applies in such a way as to prescribe the legal regime of facts entirely accomplished prior to its commencement.\n[18] In this case, it is clear that the law does not expressly say that the law is retroactive. As the General Division noted, there is no transitional provision or language to the effect that the amendment applies to claims for sickness benefits established before the law was amended.\n[19] Does the language of the law require such a construction by necessary implication?\n[20] I do not think so.\n[21] The EI Act defines an initial claim for benefits as a claim made for the purpose of establishing a claimant\u2019s benefit period. Footnote 3\n[22] Section 12 says that \u201c[i]f a benefit period has been established for a claimant, benefits may be paid to the claimant for each week of unemployment that falls in the benefit period, subject to the maximums established by this section.\u201dFootnote 4\n[23] When the Claimant established his benefit period, the maximum was 15 weeks. It became 26 weeks on December 18, 2022.Footnote 5\n[24] The language of the law does not require retroactive construction by necessary implication. On the contrary, the EI Act specifically provides that the maximum number of weeks is the one that applied when the benefit period was established.\n[25] Instead, the language of the law suggests that it applies when it takes effect, impacting claims for sickness benefits established on or after December 18, 2022.\n[26] As a result, the General Division made an error of law when it found that the Claimant was entitled to 26 weeks of sickness benefits.\n[27] This means that I am justified in intervening.\nRemedy [28] Since the record before the General Division is complete, I am in a position to give the decision that the General Division should have given.\n[29] It is not disputed that the Claimant applied for sickness benefits before the amendment to the EI Act extending sickness benefits from 15 to 26 weeks.\n[30] To be entitled to 26 weeks of sickness benefits, the claim for benefits has to be established on or after December 18, the date the EI Act was amended.\n[31] While I sympathize with the Claimant, the EI Act does not allow for an extension of the maximum period of sickness benefits and does not give the General Division or the Appeal Division the power to grant an extension of that period, regardless of the particular circumstances of a claimant\u2019s situation.\n[32] The Commission\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nConclusion [33] The appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; and Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nSee Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, [1977] 1 SCR 271.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 6(1) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\nFootnote 4\nSee section 12(1) of the EI Act.\nFootnote 5\nSee section 12(3)(c) of the EI Act.\n",

A funeral was held. On September 5, 2013, the Added Party, X, provided the Minister of Employment and Social Development (the Minister) with a death benefit application in respect of C.B. It also submitted C.B.\u2019s death certificate and an invoice for funeral services provided by X Funeral Home in respect of C.B.\nOn September 12, 2013, the Minister paid the entire death benefit to the Added Party as a partial reimbursement of those expenses. Almost nine years later, the Appellant also applied for the death benefit. The Minister refused the Appellant\u2019s application because it had already paid the death benefit to the Added Party. The Appellant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to the General Division.\nThe Canada Pension Plan sets out who is entitled to a death benefit when someone dies. By default, the death benefit is payable to the estate or succession of the deceased contributor. But there are three exceptions to this general rule. In the following three situations, the rule does not apply:\n\u00b7 After making reasonable inquiries, the Minister finds that there is no estate.\n\u00b7 The estate didn\u2019t apply within 60 days of the contributor\u2019s death.\n\u00b7 The amount of the death benefit is less than the \u201cprescribed amount\u201d.\nIf one of these exceptions applies, then the Minister may pay the death benefit to the individual or institution who paid, or is responsible for paying, the funeral expenses \u2013 but only up to the amount of the funeral expenses. Then, if the death benefit is greater than the funeral expenses, the rest of the funds may be paid to the contributor\u2019s survivor or next of kin. The Minister\u2019s power to pay the death benefit to someone other than the estate or succession of the contributor is discretionary rather than mandatory.\nIn this case, the General Division found that the exception applied. The amount of the benefit was less than the prescribed amount. Because an exception applied, the General Division found that the Minister was allowed to pay the death benefit, up to the amount of the funeral expenses, to the institution who paid the funeral expenses. Based on the invoice from the Added Party, the General Division found that the Minister reasonably concluded that the Added Party had paid, or was responsible for paying, the funeral expenses. The General Division dismissed the appeal and found that the Appellant was not eligible for the death benefit in respect of C.B.\nDecision Content\nCitation: SB v Minister of Employment and Social Development and X, 2024 SST 50\nSocial Security Tribunal of Canada General Division \u2013 Income Security Section\nDecision\nAppellant: S.

B., isn\u2019t eligible for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) death benefit in respect of her daughter, C. B. This decision explains why I am dismissing the appeal.\nOverview [3] The death benefit is a one-time payment that is payable when a person dies.\n[4] On August 17, 2013, C. B. passed away.Footnote 1 A funeral was held.\n[5] On September 5, 2013, the Added Party, X, provided Service Canada (that is, the Minister of Employment and Social Development) with a death benefit application in respect of C. B..Footnote 2 It also submitted C. B.\u2019s death certificate and an invoice for funeral services provided by X Funeral Home in respect of C. B..Footnote 3 The invoice was dated August 20, 2013. Specific items listed were \u201carranging & administration,\u201d \u201cclergy honourarium,\u201d and \u201cdeath registration fee\u201d totalling $5,665.81.\n[6] On September 12, 2013, the Minister paid the entire death benefit (which was $556.50) to the Added Party as a partial reimbursement of those expenses.Footnote 4\n[7] On March 14, 2022 (almost nine years later), the Appellant also applied for the death benefit.Footnote 5 She too submitted a copy of C. B.\u2019s death certificate and an invoice dated August 22, 2013, for services provided by X Funeral Home in respect of C. B. The only item on the invoice was \u201cautomobiles\u201d totalling $339.00.Footnote 6 In addition, she submitted two invoices from X for the cemetery lot, the headstone, and the burial. These two invoices totalled $5,593.50.Footnote 7\n[8] The Minister refused the Appellant\u2019s application because it had already paid the death benefit to the Added Party. The Appellant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s General Division.\nWhat I have to decide [9] I have to decide whether the Appellant is eligible for the death benefit.\nWhat the law says [10] The Canada Pension Plan sets out who is entitled to a death benefit when someone dies. By default, the death benefit is payable to the estate or succession of the deceased contributor.Footnote 8 But there are three exceptions to this general rule. In the following three situations, the rule does not apply:Footnote 9\na) After making reasonable inquiries, the Minister finds that there is no estate. b) The estate didn\u2019t apply within 60 days of the contributor\u2019s death. c) The amount of the death benefit is less than the \u201cprescribed amount.\u201d\n[11] If one of these exceptions applies, then the Minister may pay the death benefit to the individual or institution who paid, or is responsible for paying, the funeral expenses\u2014but only up to the amount of the funeral expenses.Footnote 10 Then, if the death benefit is greater than the funeral expenses, the rest of the funds may be paid to the contributor\u2019s survivor or next of kin.Footnote 11\n[12] The Minister\u2019s power to pay the death benefit to somone other than the estate or succession of the contributor is discretionary rather than mandatory. This means the Minister may use this power but it doesn\u2019t have to. If it uses this power, it must act judicially. In other words, the Minister must not:\nact in bad faith act for an improper purpose or motive (the wrong reason) consider an irrelevant factor ignore a relevant factor discriminateFootnote 12\nReasons for my decision [13] In this case, an exception to the rule applied. The amount of the death benefit was less than the prescribed amount. Based on the date of C. B.\u2019s death, the \u201cprescribed amount\u201d of the death benefit was $2,387.Footnote 13 The Minister calculated the actual amount of the death benefit using section 57(1) of the Canada Pension Plan, as it was required to do. It calculated the actual death benefit to be $556.50.Footnote 14 This is less than the prescribed amount of $2,387.\n[14] Because an exception applied, the Minister was allowed to pay the death benefit, up to the amount of the funeral expenses, to the institution who paid the funeral expenses. Based on the invoice from the Added Party, the Minister reasonably concluded that the Added Party had paid, or was responsible for paying, the funeral expenses.\n[15] The death benefit was less than the amount of the funeral expenses. So it paid the full death benefit to the Added Party. There was nothing left over to pay to C. B.\u2019s survivor or next of kin, including the Appellant.\n[16] The Minister followed the rules in the Canada Pension Plan when it used its power to pay the death benefit to the Added Party.\n[17] Furthermore, the Minister acted judicially. There is no evidence that the Minister acted in bad faith, or for an improper purpose or motive, or in a discriminatory way. There is no evidence that it considered an irrelevant factor or ignored a relevant factor. There was no evidence before the Minister at the time to suggest that the Added Party had not actually paid the funeral expenses on the invoice it provided, or that someone else (like the Appellant) had paid some of the funeral expenses as well.\n[18] When the Minister has properly paid the death benefit, as it did here, it isn\u2019t required to pay the death benefit to anyone else who might apply later.Footnote 15\nConclusion [19] I find that the Appellant isn\u2019t eligible for the death benefit in respect of C. B.\n[20] This means the appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee GD2-14.\nFootnote 2\nSee GD4-14 to 16.\nFootnote 3\nSee GD4-17 and 18.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD4-16 for the payment date and GD7-6 for the amount of the death benefit.\nFootnote 5\nSee GD2-11 to 13.\nFootnote 6\nSee GD2-14 and 15.\nFootnote 7\nSee GD2-16 and 17.\nFootnote 8\nSee sections 44(1)(c) and 71(1) of the Canada Pension Plan (Act).\nFootnote 9\nSee section 71(2) of the Act and section 64(1) of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations (Regulations).\nFootnote 10\nSee sections 64(1) and (2) of the Regulations.\nFootnote 11\nSee section 64(3) of the Regulations.\nFootnote 12\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Uppal, 2008 FCA 388; and Canada (Attorney General) v Purcell, [1996] 1 FC 644.\nFootnote 13\nSee section 64(1) of the Regulations. The Appellant asked why the death benefit wasn\u2019t $2,500. The death benefit is only $2,500 if the contributor died after December 31, 2018, and if the death benefit is payable to the estate or succession of the contributor. See section 57(1)(b) of the Canada Pension Plan.\nFootnote 14\nThe Minister used C.\u2019s CPP contributions (GD7-4) to make this calculation.\nFootnote 15\nSee section 71(3) of the Act.\n",

G.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 24, 2023 (GP-23-419)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: January 19, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-39\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not go ahead. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] A. G. (Claimant) has lived in Canada since October 2016. He applied for an Old Age Security (OAS) pension in October 2021. On his OAS application, he asked that payment of his pension begin at the earliest opportunity.\n[3] To collect a partial OAS pension, claimants must be at least 65 years old, in Canada legally, and have lived in Canada for at least ten years.Footnote 1 If claimants don\u2019t have ten years of residence in Canada, they can still have a partial OAS pension if they have lived in a country or countries that have social security agreements with Canada. Those agreements can help claimants meet the ten-year residence requirement. But the years of residence in other countries based on those agreements are not counted when calculating the amount of the OAS pension.Footnote 2\n[4] The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) found that given the Claimant\u2019s residence in Canada, and St. Lucia and Antigua and Barbuda based on social security agreements, he was entitled to a partial OAS pension of 4\/40ths.\n[5] The Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider the amount of the pension. The Minister did not change the calculation on reconsideration.\n[6] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal, finding that the Minister had not made any error in the calculation of the Claimant\u2019s OAS pension. The additional years the Claimant resided in countries with which Canada has social security agreements allowed the Claimant to qualify for a partial pension, but those years don\u2019t increase the amount of the Claimant\u2019s partial OAS pension. The Claimant raised other issues with the OAS process which were not issues the General Division could make decisions about or fix.\nIssues [7] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Is there an arguable case that the General Division made an error that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [8] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 3\n[9] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 4\n[10] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division [11] The Claimant argues that the General Division ignored the evidence he provided about being misinformed by the Minister\u2019s website. The website describes how the Minister decides who is eligible for an OAS partial pension and how residency will dictate the amount of that pension.\n[12] The Claimant also argues that natural justice would require the Minister to concede (or for the Appeal Division to allow the appeal) because he did not understand the law about how the Minister calculates partial pensions in his situation until the General Division explained it.Footnote 5\n[13] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division. The Claimant believed that his years of residency outside Canada wouldn\u2019t just be counted towards his eligibility for a partial OAS pension. He thought those years would increase the amount of OAS pension he would receive. It wasn\u2019t until the General Division hearing that the Claimant understood how the rules about residency and OAS partial pensions work. The Claimant argues that General Division should have given him credit for being misinformed about partial OAS pensions by material on the Minister\u2019s website.\n[14] However, there is no arguable case that the General Division had the power to credit the Claimant for being misinformed about the law. As a result, it cannot be an error for the General Division to ignore the evidence about the website.\n[15] The General Division must apply the law about calculating OAS partial pensions exactly as it is written, regardless of how much the Claimant understood about it. If the Claimant was misinformed about the state of the law, the General Division doesn\u2019t have any powers to increase the amount of his partial pension as a result.\n[16] I cannot give the Claimant permission to appeal. There is no argument here about the Minister miscalculating the Claimant\u2019s partial OAS pension that has a reasonable chance of success.\n[17] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence.Footnote 6 The General Division calculated the OAS pension based on the years the Claimant was a resident in Canada and abroad under the relevant social security agreements.\n[18] The Claimant\u2019s appeal raised important concerns about his experience with Service Canada both in terms of the letters and requests he received, and the information he tried to find on their website. However, this Tribunal has no power to address those experiences.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t set out new evidence [19] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division, so new evidence cannot form the reason for giving permission to appeal.\nConclusion [20] I\u2019ve refused permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 3(2) and 4 of the Old Age Security Act (OAS Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 40(1)(d) and (e) of the OAS Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 4\nSee section 58.1(c) in the Act.\nFootnote 5\nSee AD1-2.\nFootnote 6\nThe Federal Court anticipates this kind of review by the Appeal Division in Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

V.\nRepresentative: G. J.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nDecision under appeal: Canada Employment Insurance Commission reconsideration decision (620968) dated October 17, 2023 (issued by Service Canada)\nTribunal member: Jos\u00e9e Langlois\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 16, 2024\nHearing participants: Appellant Appellant\u2019s representative Creole interpreter\nDecision date: January 17, 2024\nFile number: GE-23-3248\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\n[2] The Appellant has shown that he was available for work from July 9, 2023. He is entitled to receive Employment Insurance (EI) benefits as of that time.\nOverview [3] On July 28, 2023, the Appellant made an EI claim. He explained that he had a work permit that allowed him to work in Canada for the employer X, but that he had stopped working on July 7, 2023.\n[4] On October 17, 2023, the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that the Appellant was disentitled from receiving EI regular benefits from July 9, 2023, because he wasn\u2019t available for work. It said that he had a restricted work permit and hadn\u2019t shown he had made reasonable and customary efforts to find a job.\n[5] The Appellant has to be available for work to get EI regular benefits. Availability is an ongoing requirement. This means that the Appellant has to be searching for a job.\n[6] The Appellant argues that he is available for work and wants to find a job. He says he has made multiple efforts to find another job since being laid off from X.\n[7] I have to decide whether the Appellant was available for work. He has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means that he has to show that it is more likely than not that he was available for work.\nIssue [8] Was the Appellant available for work from July 9, 2023?\nAnalysis Reasonable and customary efforts to find a job [9] The law sets out criteria for me to consider when deciding whether the Appellant\u2019s efforts were reasonable and customary.Footnote 1 I have to look at whether his efforts were sustained and whether they were directed toward finding a suitable job. In other words, the Appellant has to have kept trying to find a suitable job.\n[10] I also have to consider the Appellant\u2019s efforts to find a job. The Employment Insurance Regulations list nine job search activities I have to consider. Some examples of those activities are the following:Footnote 2\nassessing employment opportunities preparing a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or cover letter registering for job search tools or with online job banks or employment agencies contacting employers who may be hiring applying for jobs\n[11] The Commission argues that the Appellant\u2019s work permit unduly limits his chances of finding a job, since it restricts him to the only employer listed on the permit.\n[12] The Commission also says that the Appellant hasn\u2019t provided evidence that he actually made the efforts he described to get an open work permit.\n[13] In addition, the Commission says that the Appellant didn\u2019t make active and sustained job search efforts. It says that, even though he says he made efforts to find a job, he is unable to provide the name of a person he spoke to or the date he approached the employers mentioned.\n[14] The Appellant explains that, contrary to what the Commission says, he made multiple efforts to find a job despite having a restricted work permit.\n[15] In fact, he says that, first, he started the process to get an open work permit. His application was refused, but he challenged that decision. He is still waiting on the outcome. Meanwhile, he says that he approached many employers for jobs. He hopes an employer will agree to offer him a work permit. He also says that he left his home country to work in Canada.\n[16] On September 9, 2023, the Appellant gave the Commission a list of employers he had approached, either over the phone or in person. For example, he mentioned McDonald\u2019s, Sobeys, and Altium.Footnote 3\n[17] When he submitted his notice of appeal, he included a copy of an email exchange proving that he had approached the employers mentioned.Footnote 4\n[18] At the hearing, he explained that he had continued his job search efforts since September 9, 2023. His representative, who accompanied him at the hearing, explained that he was a supervisor at X and that, since the employer had to lay the Appellant off because of reduced operational requirements, he wanted to support him and help him in his search for another job. He said that he assisted the Appellant in all his efforts to find a job and that he took the time to explain to employers that the Appellant needed a work permit. He explained that some employers were open to this procedure.\n[19] The Appellant says that these processes are challenging, but he insists that he is willing to work, that he wants to work, and that he is capable of working. He says that he came from Haiti for a better life and that he also has to support his family.\n[20] As agreed at the hearing, given that the Commission\u2019s file shows his job search efforts between July 9, 2023, and September 9, 2023, the Appellant sent the Tribunal a list of employers he says he has approached since September 9, 2023.\n[21] According to this document, the Appellant has approached 14 employers since September 9, 2023. For example, he apparently went to the following places in person: Walmart, Dollarama, and Value Village.Footnote 5 The Appellant is looking for a job in another occupation than the one listed on his restricted work permit because, as he explained, he hopes an employer will agree to offer him a work permit based on the availability of a position he can work in. For instance, he says he is willing to work as a cashier, cleaner, salesperson, or apprentice mechanic.\n[22] The facts show that, since July 9, 2023, the Appellant has both looked for work and taken steps to change his work permit.\n[23] Of course, these processes are challenging for the Appellant, whose mother tongue is Creole, but he has someone supporting him in his efforts, and he is persevering.\n[24] The explanations given at the hearing and the document sent to the Tribunal after the hearing satisfy me that the Appellant not only wants to work, but he is also taking whatever steps he can to that end.\n[25] I find that the Appellant has shown that he was available for work from July 9, 2023.\nCapable of and available for work [26] Case law sets out three factors for me to consider when deciding whether a claimant is capable of and available for work but unable to find a suitable job. The Appellant has to prove the following three things:Footnote 6\nHe wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available. He made efforts to find a suitable job. He didn\u2019t set personal conditions that might have unduly (in other words, overly) limited his chances of going back to work.\n[27] When I consider each of these factors, I have to look at the Appellant\u2019s attitude and conduct.Footnote 7\nWanting to go back to work [28] The Commission says that the Appellant didn\u2019t have an immediate desire to go back to work. It says that a claimant must show an immediate desire to put an end to their period of unemployment as soon as possible and that the Appellant had to show that he was looking for a job. According to the Commission, that isn\u2019t the case.\n[29] The Appellant argues that he has wanted to find another job since he stopped working for X. He says he has taken steps to change his restricted work permit and that he wants the chance to find an employer who will hire him.\n[30] I am of the view that the Appellant wanted\u2014and still wants\u2014to go back to work as soon as possible.\n[31] The Appellant has shown that he wanted to go back to work as soon as a suitable job was available. I must now consider whether he made concrete efforts to find a job.Footnote 8\nMaking efforts to find a suitable job [32] To be able to get EI benefits, the Appellant is responsible for actively looking for a suitable job.Footnote 9\n[33] The Commission argues that the Appellant hasn\u2019t shown that he made active efforts to find work, since he wasn\u2019t able to provide details.\n[34] It is true that the Commission\u2019s file shows that, on August 22, 2023, the Appellant said that he hadn\u2019t [translation] \u201cmade that many job search efforts\u201d because he was in a difficult situation. However, I note that during that same conversation, he explained that he had taken steps to change his work permit. He also said that he wanted to work and to find an employer who would hire him.\n[35] EI benefits are meant to compensate for unemployment when a worker is looking for and intends to find a suitable job. The Appellant has to prove his availability by making efforts to find a job each working day of his benefit period.\n[36] At the hearing, the Appellant\u2019s representative said that he was a supervisor at X and that he had taken on the task of helping the Appellant get back to work. He indicated that he had helped and continued to help the Appellant look for another job.\n[37] As mentioned, the Appellant submitted a document showing his job search efforts since September 9, 2023, and his notice of appeal describes his efforts between July 9, 2023, and September 9, 2023. It is true that he didn\u2019t provide the names of the people he met, but his representative said that he was supporting him and that he explained the work permit process to employers.\n[38] I find that the Appellant has shown his desire to go back to work by making significant efforts to find a suitable job each working day of his benefit period from July 9, 2023.\nUnduly limiting chances of going back to work [39] The Appellant argues that he wants to find a job and that he is capable of working even though he has a restricted work permit. He explains that, despite the permit restrictions, he continues to make efforts to change his work permit, and he is trying to find an employer who would hire him.\n[40] The facts show that the Appellant has a work permit that allows him to work in Canada for the period from November 30, 2022, to November 29, 2024.Footnote 10 The conditions of that permit include that the Appellant has to leave Canada by November 29, 2024, that he can\u2019t work other than as a printing machine operator, and that he can\u2019t work for any employer other than X.\n[41] The conditions of the permit unduly limit the Appellant from finding a suitable job only if he doesn\u2019t make any efforts to find a job and to get permission to work for another employer. In fact, if an employer were to terminate such an employment contract, it could issue a letter of discharge to the worker. At the hearing, the Appellant explained that the employer had issued him a letter of discharge. This means that he can take steps to get a work permit approved by another employer.\n[42] In addition, a decision from the Tribunal\u2019s Appeal Division says that a work permit restriction doesn\u2019t automatically make a claimant unavailable for work as long as the restriction can be lifted or the permit can be assigned to a different employer.Footnote 11\n[43] In my view, that is the case for the Appellant. Restricting their availability to a single employer, not the work permit itself, is what unduly limits a claimant\u2019s chances of finding a suitable job.\n[44] In this case, the Appellant stopped working on July 7, 2023, and I accept his explanation that he has both taken steps to change his work permit and looked for an employer who would hire him.\n[45] I find that, by taking all the appropriate steps, the Appellant has shown a desire to go back to work as soon as possible and that the conditions listed on his restricted work permit limit him only if he doesn\u2019t try to change them.\n[46] I give the most weight to the Appellant\u2019s statements at the hearing. Given the circumstances, I am of the view that the Appellant\u2019s chances of finding a suitable job weren\u2019t limited by a personal condition.\nSo, was the Appellant capable of and available for work? [47] I have to apply the criteria for determining whether the Appellant was available for work within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act and whether he can get benefits from July 9, 2023.\n[48] In this case, I have assessed the Appellant\u2019s attitude. His attitude shows that he wants to find a job and that he made every effort he could. These efforts are significant, customary, and reasonable.\n[49] Based on my findings on the three factors, I find that the Appellant has shown that he was capable of and available for work.\nConclusion [50] This means that the appeal is allowed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 9.001 of the Employment Insurance Regulations (Regulations) and section 50(8) of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 2\nSee section 9.001 of the Regulations.\nFootnote 3\nSee GD3-19, GD2-16, and GD2-17.\nFootnote 4\nSee GD2-14.\nFootnote 5\nSee GD05.\nFootnote 6\nThese three factors appear in Faucher v Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, A-56-96 and A-57-96.

The appeal will not go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] S. P. (Claimant) was married in December 1976. She separated in March 2001 and divorced in November 2003.\n[3] The Claimant applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) credit split (also called a division of unadjusted pensionable earnings, or DUPE) in July 2019. She was already receiving a CPP retirement pension at the time. She says she only applied for the credit split because someone from Service Canada told her she would receive more money if she did.\n[4] The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) approved the application. The former couple\u2019s CPP credits were divided between them for the years 1976 through 2000.\n[5] Because of the credit split, the amount of the Appellant\u2019s retirement pension went down, not up. She asked the Minister to reconsider its decision, and the Minister didn\u2019t change its position. She appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division dismissed her appeal, finding that the credit split cannot be reversed.\nIssues [6] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Has the Claimant raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [7] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[8] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[9] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nNo arguable case for an error [10] The Claimant appealed the General Division decision because she says she\u2019s entitled to the amount of retirement pension payments she received before the credit split. She doesn\u2019t understand how or why the amount of her pension payments was decreased. She would like to go back to receiving the payments she received before the credit split.Footnote 3\n[11] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division. The General Division explained the following:\nThe Claimant applied to split her pension credits (she did this because she believed it would increase her monthly pension payment amount).Footnote 4 The CPP says the credit split shall take place if the Minister is informed of a divorce and receives certain information.Footnote 5 The Claimant is divorced, and she provided the information to the Minister (the application for the credit split, the declaration that she was married, and the divorce certificate).Footnote 6 The credit split must take place in the Claimant\u2019s situation.Footnote 7 There are only two situations in which the Minister can refuse to allow the credit split, but neither applies here. First, the Minister can refuse to allow the credit split when the payments to both people decrease because of the credit split. But in this case, only the Claimant\u2019s payments went down (the Claimant\u2019s former spouse didn\u2019t apply for the retirement pension). Second, the Minister can refuse to allow the credit split when, in certain situations, the couple make a written agreement before their divorce not to split the pension credits. The Claimant didn\u2019t have that kind of agreement before the divorce.Footnote 8 The credit split started and ended on the correct dates. The credits were split from January 1976 (the year they got married) to December 2000 (the end of the year before they stopped living together).Footnote 9\n[12] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error. The General Division applied the law about splitting pension credits to the Claimant\u2019s situation. There\u2019s no argument here that the General Division misunderstood what the law says about when credit splits must take place. There\u2019s no argument here that the General Division misunderstood the Claimant\u2019s situation: she provided the Minister with the information that meant that the credit split had to happen. She was not in one of the two situations in which the Minister can make an exception to the credit split rule.\n[13] I\u2019ve reviewed the record. I\u2019m satisfied that there\u2019s no other evidence that the General Division ignored or misunderstood that could impact the result for the Claimant.Footnote 10\nNo new evidence [14] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any evidence that was not already presented to the General Division, so new evidence cannot form the basis for an appeal either.\nConclusion [15] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not go ahead.\nNote de bas pages\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) in the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1-3.\nFootnote 4\nSee paragraph 4 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 5\nSee paragraph 10 in the General Division decision, applying section 55.1(a) of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and sections 52 and 54 of the Canada Pension Plan Regulations.\nFootnote 6\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 7\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 8\nSee paragraphs 13 and 14 in the General Division decision, applying sections 55.1(5) and 55.2(3) of the CPP.\nFootnote 9\nSee paragraphs 15 and 16 in the General Division decision, applying section 55.1(4) and 78.1 of the CPP.\nFootnote 10\nThe Federal Court discussed the need for this kind of review by the Appeal Division in Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\n",

The Minister of Employment and Social Development (the Minister) refused the application because the Claimant did not live in Canada. The Minister said that she needed at least 20 years of Canadian residence to receive an Old Age Security pension while living outside the country. The Minister noted that the Claimant only had ten full years of residence, based on when she actually resided in Canada, plus time added through Canada\u2019s social security agreement with Estonia.\nThe Claimant appealed the Minister\u2019s decision to the General Division. The General Division allowed the appeal, granting the Claimant a partial Old Age Security pension at a rate of 11\/40ths of the full amount. The Minister appealed the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division.\nThe law says that a person\u2019s absence doesn\u2019t interrupt their residence in Canada if they were residing in Canada and they departed under selected circumstances specified in the Old Age Security Regulations. One of those circumstances is:\n- Where a person is engaged outside of Canada as an employee, member or office of an international charitable organization, if\n- They returned to Canada within six months of the end of their employment or engagement outside Canada or\n- While employed or engaged out of Canada, they attained an age at which they were eligible to be paid an Old Age Security pension.\nIn this case, the Claimant co-founded a Latvian non-profit organization called X in September 2020 and has apparently sat on its executive committee ever since. The\nClaimant said that X operates in Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Serbia raising money to provide food, clothing, and skills to those in need.\nThe Appeal Division held that the words \u201cengaged\u201d, \u201cmember\u201d and \u201cinternational charitable organization\u201d under the Old Age Security Regulations are subject to broad interpretation. The Appeal Division held that even if it accepted that the Claimant had been and continues to be engaged as a member of an international charitable organization, she still couldn\u2019t succeed. This was because the Claimant didn\u2019t meet all the conditions required to count her absence as a period of residence in Canada. The Appeal Division couldn\u2019t find that the Claimant remained a Canadian resident, even though she might have been engaged with X, because she had not attained an age at which she was eligible to be paid an Old Age Security pension. When the Claimant left Canada in June 2017, she was already 67 years old, well past the age of 65, when she first \u201cattained\u201d eligibility for the Old Age Security Pension. The law requires claimants who are working for an international charity outside Canada to, not just be eligible, but become eligible for the pension while they are abroad.\nAlthough the Claimant may have been working for an international charity, the Appeal Division found that she was not a resident of Canada when she applied for the Old Age Security pension in August 2020. At that time, the Claimant had just under 11 years of Canadian residence \u2013 short of the 20 years that she needed to collect a partial Old Age Security pension while living outside Canada. The Appeal Division allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal. The Claimant is not entitled to a partial Old Age Security pension.\nDecision Content\nCitation: Minister of Employment and Social Development v LK, 2024 SST 62\nSocial Security Tribunal of Canada Appeal Division\nLeave to Appeal Decision\nAppellant: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nRepresentative: Yanick B\u00e9langer\nRespondent: L.

She immigrated to Canada on September 25, 2007, and stayed in this country until June 6, 2016, when she moved back to Serbia. She still lives in Serbia.\n[3] The Respondent applied for an OAS pension in August 2020. The Minister of Employment and Social Development refused the application because the Respondent did not live in Canada. The Minister said that she needed at least 20 years of Canadian residence to receive an OAS pension while living outside the country. The Minister noted that the Respondent only had ten full years of residence, based on when she actually resided in Canada, plus time added through Canada\u2019s social security agreement with Estonia.Footnote 1\n[4] The Respondent appealed the Minister\u2019s refusal to the Social Security Tribunal. The Tribunal\u2019s General Division conducted a hearing in writing and allowed the appeal, granting the Respondent a partial OAS pension at a rate of 11\/40ths of the full amount.\n[5] The Minister disagreed with the General Division\u2019s decision. It applied for permission to appeal to the Appeal Division, arguing that the General Division had committed an error of law by granting a pension to a non-resident who had lived in Canada for less than 20 years. Last September, one of my colleagues on the Appeal Division granted the Minister permission to appeal. Earlier this month, I held a hearing to discuss its case in full.\n[6] Now that I have considered submissions from both parties, I have concluded that the Respondent was not entitled to receive a partial OAS pension. The evidence shows that the Respondent was not living in Canada when she applied for the pension and did not have the required minimum 20 years of Canadian residence to receive it abroad.\nPreliminary matters [7] In the months leading up to her hearing, the Respondent submitted dozens of emails and other documents, many of them concerning matters such as her claim for Ontario Disability Support Program benefits, that had nothing to do with the issues in this proceeding. Although, I reviewed all of the Respondent\u2019s material, I focused only on information that was relevant to her eligibility for the OAS pension, in particular her periods of residence in Canada and whether she was in a position to benefit from social security agreements with other countries.\n[8] After the hearing, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal additional emails that expanded on arguments she had already made orally and in writing.Footnote 2 I have decided not to consider these arguments because (i) they contain nothing new and (ii) they came after, not just the filing deadline, but the hearing itself.\n[9] The emails also repeated the Respondent\u2019s allegation, originally made at the hearing, that Mr. B\u00e9langer was not duly authorized to represent the Minister. Against the Respondent\u2019s objection, I proceeded with the hearing because I saw nothing to suggest that Mr. B\u00e9langer, who I accept is an employee of the Department of Justice, could not speak on the Minister\u2019s behalf in this matter. My ruling on this question was final, and I see no reason to revisit it again.\nAnalysis [10] I have applied the law to the available evidence. I am satisfied that the Respondent did not meet the burden of showing that she was entitled to the OAS pension. The Respondent showed that she had nearly nine years of actual residence in Canada and more than two years of creditable periods from Estonia. However, notwithstanding her work for an international charitable organization during the previous four years, the Respondent was living outside Canada when she applied for the pension. None of these periods added up to the 20 years that she needed to receive an OAS pension while living abroad.\nThe Respondent had nearly nine years of residence in Canada [11] A person resides in Canada if they make their home and ordinarily live in any part of Canada.Footnote 3\n[12] The Respondent arrived in Canada as a landed immigrant on September 25, 2007, and settled in Brampton, Ontario. She rented an apartment, opened a bank account, made friends, and received health care and social benefits. She remained in Canada until June 6, 2016, when she moved to Serbia. She does not appear to have maintained any significant ties to Canada since then.\n[13] The Respondent and the Minister agree on the above dates. For that reason, I accept that the Respondent actually lived in Canada for eight years and 257 days. The Respondent had more than two years of creditable periods from Estonia\n[14] The Respondent argues that her years of residence in three countries help her qualify for an OAS pension. I agree with her, but only up to a point.\n[15] Canada has social security agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Serbia. The agreements all say that creditable periods under the laws of those countries may be considered as periods of residence in Canada for the purpose of helping a claimant qualify for certain federal benefits.Footnote 4\n[16] The Minister requested information from all three countries, but only Estonia affirmed that the Respondent had creditable periods under its agreement with Canada. According to the government of Estonia, the Respondent had creditable periods that added two years and 103 days to her Canadian residence.Footnote 5\n[17] Similar requests from Latvia or Serbia yielded nothing that helped the Respondent. Neither country recognized creditable periods under their agreements with Canada.Footnote 6\n[18] The Respondent insisted that she had creditable periods from Latvia and Serbia and that the government of Canada should have done something to force those countries to disclose them. However, I can only rely on the evidence before me. Although neither country said what the Respondent wanted them to say, I have no reason to believe that they might be concealing information.\nThe Respondent may have working for an international charitable organization, but she was not a resident of Canada when she applied for the OAS pension [19] The Respondent has not actually lived in Canada since June 6, 2016. But she claims that she has nevertheless been a Canadian resident since then because she has been working for an international charitable organization for the past eight years.\n[20] The law says that a person\u2019s absence doesn\u2019t interrupt their residence in Canada if they were residing in Canada and they departed under selected circumstances specified in the Old Age Security Regulations.Footnote 7 One of those circumstances is:\nwhere a person is engaged outside of Canada as an employee, member or officer of an international charitable organization, if\nthey returned to Canada within six months of the end of their employment or engagement outside Canada or while employed or engaged out of Canada, they attained an age at which they were eligible to be paid an OAS pension [emphasis added].Footnote 8\n[21] The Respondent co-founded a Latvian non-profit organization called X in September 2000 and has apparently sat on its executive committee ever since.Footnote 9 The Respondent said that X operates in Latvia, Uzbekistan, and Serbia raising money to provide food, clothing, and skills to those in need.\n[22] The words \u201cengaged,\u201d \u201cmember,\u201d and \u201cinternational charitable organization\u201d are subject to broad interpretation. I am not sure whether X is still active, nor do I know how \u201cengaged\u201d the Respondent is in its activities. However, even if I accept that the Respondent has been and continues to be engaged as a member of an international charitable organization, she still can\u2019t succeed.\n[23] That\u2019s because the Respondent didn\u2019t meet all the conditions required to count her absence as a period of residence in Canada. The Respondent was residing in Canada immediately before she left for Serbia, and she has hasn\u2019t returned to Canada since. But I can\u2019t find that she remains a Canadian resident, even though she might have been engaged with X, because she had not attained an age at which she was eligible to be paid an OAS pension. When the Respondent left Canada in June 2017, she was already 67 years old, well past the age of 65, when she first \u201cattained\u201d eligibility for the OAS pension.\n[24] It is true that, if she had remained in Canada, the Respondent would have been eligible to apply for the pension at any time after her 65th birthday. But the Respondent did not remain in Canada. More to the point, \u201cbeing\u201d eligible for the OAS pension while living in Canada is not the same thing as \u201cattaining\u201d eligibility for the OAS pension while living outside Canada. The law as worded clearly requires claimants who are working for an international charity outside Canada to, not just be eligible, but become eligible for the pension while they are abroad.\nThe Respondent did not have the 20 years of Canadian residence necessary to receive the OAS pension while living outside Canada [25] The Respondent had eight years and 257 days of actual Canadian residence and, as result of the social security agreement with Latvia, two years and 103 days of creditable Canadian residence. That totals ten years and 360 days.\n[26] As we have seen, the four years that the Respondent spent working for X between her departure from Canada in June 2016 and her application for OAS benefits in August 2020 cannot be counted as a period of Canadian residence. That\u2019s because she neither returned to Canada within six months of disengaging from X nor \u201cattained\u201d the age of 65 while working for X outside Canada.\n[27] Under the law, OAS applicants who reside outside Canada at the time of their application must prove that they had previously resided in Canada for at least 20 years.Footnote 10 In August 2020, when she applied for the OAS pension, the Respondent was residing outside Canada. At the time, she did not have the 20 years required to get the pension while living abroad.\nConclusion [28] Although she may have been working for an international charity, the Respondent was not a resident of Canada when she applied for the OAS pension in August 2020. At that time, the Respondent had just under 11 years of Canadian residence \u2014 short of the 20 years that she needed to collect a partial OAS pension while living outside Canada.\n[29] The Minister\u2019s appeal is allowed. The Respondent is not entitled to a partial OAS pension.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Minister\u2019s reconsideration decision letter dated June 2, 2022, GD2-4.\nFootnote 2\nSee Respondent\u2019s emails dated January 13, 2024 (AD44) and January 17, 2024 (AD45).\nFootnote 3\nSee section 21(1)(a) of the Old Age Security Regulations (OAS Regulations).\nFootnote 4\nSee Article XII of the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Republic of Estonia, Article 11 of the Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Republic of Latvia, and Article 12 of the Agreement on Social Security between Canada and the Republic of Serbia.\nFootnote 5\nSee Agreement on Social Security Between Canada and the Republic of Estonia liaison form dated March 25, 2021, GD2-237.\nFootnote 6\nSee Agreement on Social Security Between the Republic of Serbia and Canada liaison form dated March 20, 2021 (GD2-228) and reply form from the State Social Insurance Agency of Latvia dated October 27, 2022 (GD55-3).\nFootnote 7\nSee section 21(4)(c) of the OAS Regulations.\nFootnote 8\nSee section 21(5)(b)(ix) of the OAS Regulations.\nFootnote 9\nSee a public organization registration with the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Latvia dated September 18, 2000 (translated from Latvian to English), GD45-11.\nFootnote 10\nSee section 3(2)(b) of the Old Age Security Act.

The Appellant, B. L., is not entitled to additional retroactive payments of her Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension.\n[2] This decision explains why I am dismissing the appeal.\nOverview [3] The Appellant was born in April 1963. She turned 60 years old in April 2023.\n[4] In June 2023, the Minister received her application for a CPP retirement pension.Footnote 1 The CPP retirement pension is based on contributions to the CPP. It is payable under certain conditions to contributors aged 60 and over.Footnote 2\n[5] The Minister processed the Appellant\u2019s June 2023 application with payments to start in July 2023.Footnote 3\n[6] The Appellant was dissatisfied with this start date. She stated that in May 2022 she had filled out an online application for CPP retirement. That application asked that her pension begin in May 2023. She asked for May 2023 to be the start date of her CPP retirement pension.\n[7] In September 2023, the Minister denied the Appellant\u2019s request on reconsideration.Footnote 4 It stated that there was no record on file of her having submitted a CPP retirement pension application in May 2022. The Minister\u2019s office received the application in June 2023, so the earliest date the Appellant would be entitled to the pension was July 2023.\n[8] The Appellant appealed the reconsideration decision to the Social Security Tribunal\u2019s General Division (Tribunal).\nWhat I have to decide [9] I must decide whether the Appellant is entitled to greater retroactivity of her CPP retirement pension.\n[10] I must consider these questions:\n(i) Can the Minister award greater back payments based on the 2022 application? (ii) Can the Minister award greater back payments based on the June 2023 application? (iii) Does the Appellant have an earlier deemed application date due to administrative error by the Minister?\nThe position of the Appellant [11] The Appellant testified that she and her husband completed the online application for a CPP retirement pension in May 2022.\n[12] The Appellant stated that in June 2023, she discussed her retirement pension with someone at Service Canada (the employee). The employee stated that she could see the Appellant\u2019s 2022 application. It was filed correctly, but the Minister had done nothing with it. But when the Appellant asked the Minister for reconsideration, her claim was denied. She thought that, based on her 2022 application, her retirement pension should have started in May 2023.\nThe reasons for my decision i. The 2022 application [13] There are two difficulties with the Appellant\u2019s 2022 application. First, the law says that a benefit is only payable if an application has been made and payment of the benefit has been approved.Footnote 5 Payment of the CPP retirement pension was not approved based on the May 2022 application.\n[14] Second, the May 2022 application did not generate a reconsideration decision under section 81 of the CPP. Under section 82 of the CPP, a reconsideration decision is the only basis for an appeal to the Tribunal.\n[15] On reconsideration, the Minister had the authority to decide only whether its initial decision on the June 2023 application was correct. The Minister did not have the authority to consider any other applications the Appellant might have made. As a result, the Minister could not modify the start date of the Appellant\u2019s pension based on the 2022 application.Footnote 6\nii. The 2023 application [16] For a person younger than 65 years old, the law states that if payment of the retirement pension is approved, payment starts the latest of:\nThe month the person reached age 60; The month after the Minister received the application if the person were under 65 when they applied; and The month the person chose in their application.Footnote 7\n[17] In the Appellant\u2019s case, the relevant dates are:\nThe month she turned 60 is April 2023; The month after the application was received was July 2023; and The start date the Appellant chose on her application was unknown. It is not in the file. It is reasonable to assume she asked for a start date for the retirement pension of May 2023.\n[18] The latest of the three dates is July 2023. The Minister received the Appellant\u2019s application in June 2023 and payment began as of July 2023.\n[19] The Appellant has received the maximum allowable period of retroactive payment for her pension under the CPP.\n[20] The law does not provide for retroactive payments for individuals under the age of 65.Footnote 8\niii. Does the Appellant have an earlier deemed application date due to administrative error by the Minister? [21] The Appellant insists that she sent the Minister her online application in May 2022. If true, her allegation might establish that the Minister made an \u201cadministrative error\u201d (AE) or gave \u201cerroneous advice\u201d (EA).\n[22] The CPP explains what can happen in the event of AE or EA. If the Minister is satisfied that AE or EA occurred, and part of a benefit was denied as a result, the Minister \u201cshall take such remedial action as the Minister considers appropriate\u201d to put the person back in the position they should have been in.Footnote 9\n[23] The Tribunal has no authority to intervene in a matter of AE\/EA.Footnote 10\n[24] At the hearing, the parties discussed whether in May 2022 the Appellant had received immediate notification through the My Service Canada Account that her application for a CPP retirement pension had been received.Footnote 11 The CPP website says this is supposed to happen. The Appellant didn\u2019t remember whether it had.\n[25] The Minister\u2019s representative advised the Appellant that, if she had received such a notification, she could retrieve it. She should print it out and take it to the nearest Service Canada office. She should ask them to send it to the Service Canada Centre in Scarborough, and to make a record of her conversation with them. On the basis of AE\/EA, the Appellant might be entitled to payments of her retirement pension beginning in May 2023.\n[26] I am sympathetic to the Appellant\u2019s situation. She wanted payment of her CPP retirement pension to begin in May 2023. In her view, she did everything possible to ensure this result. Instead, her payments began only two months later. She stated that she has lost more than $400 of CPP retirement payments because of \u201ca poor search of computer records.\u201dFootnote 12\n[27] I cannot help the Appellant. I am a statutory decision-maker. The provisions of the CPP are binding on me. I must interpret and apply the law as it is set out in the CPP. I have no authority to make exceptions. Nor can I make decision based on fairness, compassion, or extenuating circumstances.\nConclusion [28] I find that the Claimant is not entitled to greater retroactivity of her CPP retirement pension.\n[29] This means the appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nGD02-11\nFootnote 2\nParagraph 44(1)(a) of the CPP\nFootnote 3\nGD02-10\nFootnote 4\nGD02-6\nFootnote 5\nSubsection 60(1) of the CPP. The paragraph 60(1.2) (b) exception in some circumstances for contributors over the age of 70 to make an application does not apply here.\nFootnote 6\nSee MESD v N.A., 2021 SST 72, a decision of a member of the Appeal Division of this Tribunal on a similar case. Decisions of the Appeal Division are not binding on me, but I find this decision persuasive.\nFootnote 7\nSee paragraphs 67(3.1) (a), (b), and (d) of the CPP. Subsection 67(3) does not apply, since the Appellant did not reach the age of 65 before the day on which the Minister received the 2023 application.\nFootnote 8\nSubsection 67 (3) of the CPP\nFootnote 9\nSubsection 66(4) of the CPP.\nFootnote 10\nPincombe v Canada (Attorney General), [1995] FCJ No. 1320 (FCA); Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v Tucker, 2003 FCA 278.\nFootnote 11\nIn order to apply online, it is necessary to set up a My Service Canada Account.\nFootnote 12\nGD04-1\n",

L.\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated September 5, 2023 (GE-23-1241)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 11, 2024\nHearing participants: Appellant\u2019s representative Respondent\nDecision date: January 24, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-911\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Remedy Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\nOverview [2] The Respondent (Claimant) received $10,959 from his former employer. The Appellant (Commission) decided that the money is \u201cearnings\u201d because it is vacation pay. It allocated the earnings starting the week of December 4, 2022, at an amount of $1,692 per week. The Commission said that being separated from his job is why the Claimant received the earnings.\n[3] After reconsideration, the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the $10,959 the Claimant had received was earnings but that the Commission had not allocated those earnings correctly. It found that the amount needed to be allocated over seven weeks starting the week of November 27, 2022, at $1,692 per week. Any amount left over had to be allocated to the last week.\n[5] The Commission was given permission to appeal. It argues that the General Division made an error of law in its interpretation of section 36(9) of the Employment Insurance Regulations (EI Regulations).\n[6] I have to decide whether the General Division made an error when it found that the earnings had to be allocated from November 27, 2022.\n[7] I am allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [8] Did the General Division make an error in its interpretation of section 36(9) of the EI Regulations when it found that the earnings had to be allocated from November 27, 2022?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [9] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[10] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[11] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, I must dismiss the appeal.\nDid the General Division make an error in its interpretation of section 36(9) of the EI Regulations when it found that the earnings had to be allocated from November 27, 2022? [12] The General Division found that the $10,959 the Claimant had received was earnings but that the Commission had not allocated those earnings correctly. It found that the amount needed to be allocated over seven weeks starting the week of November 27, 2022, at $1,692 per week. Any amount left over had to be allocated to the last week.\n[13] The Commission argues that the General Division made an error in its interpretation of section 36(9) of the EI Regulations when it decided that the separation monies had to be allocated from November 27 rather than from December 4, 2022.\n[14] I take into account that it is not disputed that the Claimant\u2019s normal weekly earnings was $1,692 and that his last day worked was December 1, 2022.\n[15] The General Division decided that $1,692 had to be allocated to each week starting the week of November 27, 2022, the week the Claimant was separated from his job.\n[16] It is true that section 36(9) of the EI Regulations says that all earnings a claimant receives for being separated from their job have to be allocated starting the week of separation. However, it also says that the claimant\u2019s total earnings from their employment are, in each consecutive week except the last, equal to the claimant\u2019s normal weekly earnings from that employment.\n[17] In other words, when a claimant has received their full salary for the week they were separated from their job, the amount received must be allocated to the following week so that \u201cthe total earnings of the claimant from that employment are, in each consecutive week except the last, equal to the claimant\u2019s normal weekly earnings from that employment.\u201d Footnote 2\n[18] However, if a claimant only worked part of their normal work week, the amount will be allocated to the week of separation.\n[19] So, I find that the General Division made an error in its interpretation of section 36(9) of the EI Regulations. It incorrectly decided that the separation monies had to be allocated starting the week of November 27 instead of the week of December 4, 2022, because the Claimant received his full salary the week he was separated from his job.\n[20] This means that I am justified in intervening on this issue.\nRemedy [21] I find that the parties had the opportunity to present their case before the General Division. So, I will give the decision that the General Division should have given.\n[22] The evidence shows that the Claimant\u2019s claim for benefits, which was initially supposed to end on January 14, 2023, was extended by six (6) weeks to February 25, 2023. However, the allocation of earnings has to start the week of December 4, 2022, because the Claimant received his full salary for the week of November 27, 2022.\n[23] The $10,959 has to be allocated starting the week of December 4, 2022, at $1,692 per week, with $807 being allocated to the last week, that of January 15, 2023. The Claimant has to repay $638.Footnote 3\n[24] The Claimant argues that he is entitled to pay back only the net amount he received, not the gross amount.\n[25] EI benefits, like wages, are payable gross, less mandatory withholding tax. The Claimant can contact the appropriate tax agency about a possible refund of the tax withheld on the EI benefits he has to repay, so he can recover the difference between the gross amount and the net amount of the overpayment.\nConclusion [26] The Commission\u2019s appeal is allowed.\n[27] The Claimant has to pay back a total of $638.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; and Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nSee Canada Employment Insurance Commission v WC, 2022 SST 595.\nFootnote 3\nSee the table at GD3-26.\n",

On March 13, 2020, he lost his job because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He applied for benefits. He received a $2,000 advance payment from the Respondent (Commission). He stopped completing his reports after two weeks, feeling that the benefits he had received covered his loss of income, which amounted to roughly $3,000.\n[3] After looking into it, the Commission asked the Appellant to pay back the $2,000 advance payment. The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider, but it upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division decided that the Claimant had to pay back the $2,000 he had received from the Commission as an advance payment of the Employment Insurance Emergency Response Benefit (EI ERB).\n[5] The Claimant was given permission to appeal the General Division decision. He argues that the General Division ignored facts and made an error of law when it found that he needed to pay back the $2,000.\n[6] I am allowing the Claimant\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [7] Did the General Division make an error when it found that the Claimant had to pay back the $2,000 EI ERB advance payment he had received from the Commission?\nAnalysis The parties agree on the outcome of the appeal [8] The parties participated in a settlement conference. The parties agree that the General Division made an error by failing to consider sections 153.7(1), 153.7 (1.1), and 153.8(1) of the Employment Insurance Act, which read as follows:\n153.7 (1) An employment insurance emergency response benefit is payable to a claimant who makes a claim under section 153.8 and who is eligible for the benefit.\n[\u2026]\n(1.1) The Commission may pay the employment insurance emergency response benefit in advance of the customary time for paying it.\n[\u2026]\n153.8 (1) Any claimant may, in the form and manner established by the Minister, make a claim for the employment insurance emergency response benefit for any two-week period starting on a Sunday and falling within the period beginning on March 15, 2020 and ending on October 3, 2020.\n[9] I agree with the parties. This means that I am justified in intervening.\nI accept the outcome proposed by the parties [10] The Claimant does not have to pay back the $2,000 EI ERB advance payment he received from the Commission. However, he is not entitled to additional weeks of EI ERB.\nConclusion [11] The appeal is allowed. The Claimant does not have to pay back the $2,000 EI ERB advance payment he received from the Commission.\n",

A.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated December 29, 2023 (GP-23-464)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: January 26, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-63\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not go ahead to the next step. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] A. A. (Claimant) was granted an Old Age Security (OAS) pension on May 10, 2020, with an effective date of June 2020.\n[3] The Claimant didn\u2019t apply for this pension. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) auto-enrolled the Claimant.\n[4] The Claimant asked the Minister to reconsider its decision on June 16, 2022, almost two years later. On January 5, 2023, the Minister refused to reconsider its decision because the time limit to do so had passed and the Claimant was too late. It also said that a person may request cancellation of a pension \u201cno later than six months after the day on which payment of the pension begins.\u201dFootnote 1\n[5] To receive more time from the Minister to request reconsideration, the Claimant had to meet four criteria. He had to show the Minister that:Footnote 2\nHe had a reasonable explanation for being late; He always meant to ask the Minister to reconsider its decision (this is called a \u201ccontinuing intention\u201d); The reconsideration request has a reasonable chance of success; and Giving the Claimant more time wouldn\u2019t be unfair to another party.\n[6] The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal. The General Division confirmed that the Claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration was late. Accordingly, the General Division considered whether the Minister exercised its discretion judicially when it refused to give the Claimant more time to request a reconsideration. The General Division explained that if the Minister does any of the following, then it didn\u2019t exercise its discretion judicially:\nacted in bad faith; acted for an improper purpose or motive; considered an irrelevant factor; ignored a relevant factor.Footnote 3\n[7] The General Division concluded that the Minister had acted judicially when it refused to give the Claimant more time to request reconsideration.\nIssues [8] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Has the Claimant raised any argument for an error by the General Division that has a reasonable chance of success? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [9] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 4\n[10] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 5\n[11] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThe Claimant hasn\u2019t raised any argument about an error by the General Division that has a reasonable chance of success [12] The Claimant has made a series of arguments about errors that he says the General Division made, as follows:\nThe General Division failed to consider the problems with auto-enrolling people in OAS when they are in the Claimant\u2019s situation (that is, they are working and will be subject to 100% of the benefit being clawed back, and lower payments from OAS later). The General Division ignored the reason the Claimant delayed in requesting reconsideration, which had to do with the COVID-19 pandemic (both in terms of work pressures and his ability to attend a Service Canada location in-person). The General Division ignored or failed to consider how long the Minister took to respond to his request for reconsideration, which calls into question the fairness of enforcing strict timelines running against him.Footnote 6\n[13] None of these arguments have a reasonable chance of success on appeal, so I cannot grant permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case for an error by failing to discuss the problems with OAS auto-enrollment [14] The Claimant has raised a series of problems with auto-enrolling people for the OAS. He acknowledges that this approach benefits some people (particularly those with low incomes) and can reduce administrative burden for the Minister. However, he argues auto-enrolling him was a problem because the Minister already knew (or ought to have known) that the full benefit would be clawed back because of his income. Auto-enrollment, he says, merely reduced his overall benefit and put the onus on him to correct the problem by requesting not to be auto-enrolled. The Claimant says that the Minister acted in bad faith by auto-enrolling him for OAS, given his circumstances.\n[15] There\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division ignored this issue. In fact, the General Division considered the Claimant\u2019s argument about auto-enrollment in some detail.Footnote 7 The General Division found that the Minister did not need to consider the effect of the auto-enrollment, given the following:\nThe Minister sent the Claimant letters about the auto-enrollment with contact information and online resources if he was confused. The Claimant did not contact the Minister for clarification. After the Minister auto-enrolled the Claimant, he still had six months to request to cancel the OAS.\n[16] Given those facts, the General Division concluded that the problems the Claimant had with auto-enrollment were not a relevant factor that the Minister ignored.\n[17] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division. The General Division considered the argument about the role that auto-enrollment could have played in the Minister\u2019s exercise of discretion. The Claimant hasn\u2019t shown that he has a reasonable chance of success by arguing the General Division ignored this issue or got the facts wrong about how auto-enrollment worked in his situation.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case for an error by failing to consider the reason the Claimant was late requesting reconsideration [18] The Claimant argues that the General Division failed to consider the evidence he gave about the reason he was late requesting reconsideration. The Claimant explained that work was very busy for him during the pandemic, and that Service Canada centres were closed at one point. He did not attend a Service Canada centre until 2022 because of the pandemic.\n[19] The General Division noted in its decision that the Claimant explained he didn\u2019t correct the auto-enrollment once he became aware of it because he was extremely busy at work and didn\u2019t want to enter a Service Canada centre due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Footnote 8 The General Division was only considering whether the Minister acted judicially when looking at the reason the Claimant was late and it did that. Therefore, I cannot conclude that the General Division ignored or misunderstood this information.\n[20] The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case for an error by the General Division that has a reasonable chance of success.\nNo arguable case for an error by failing to consider how long the Minister took to respond to the Claimant [21] The Claimant argues that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring evidence about how long the Minister took after the Minister auto-enrolled the Claimant and he requested that they reconsider.\n[22] The General Division didn\u2019t discuss any delay on the Minister\u2019s part. However, that fact doesn\u2019t help establish an arguable case that the General Division made an error.\n[23] The General Division is presumed to have considered all the evidence, even if it doesn\u2019t discuss every piece of evidence in the decision. The Claimant can overcome that presumption by showing that the evidence was important enough that the General Division needed to discuss.Footnote 9\n[24] In my view, the time that the Minister took to respond to the request for reconsideration isn\u2019t relevant to the question the General Division had to decide, so it\u2019s not an error of fact for the General Division to ignore it. The General Division was only deciding whether the Minister acted judicially when applying the factors for more time. The amount of time the Minister took to respond to the reconsideration is not a factor the General Division needed to consider, nor is it relevant to the factors the Minister had to consider about giving the Claimant more time.\nNo new evidence [25] The Claimant hasn\u2019t set out any new evidence that wasn\u2019t already presented to the General Division, so new evidence cannot form the reason for permission to appeal.\nConclusion [26] I have refused the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nMinister\u2019s Reconsideration Decision Letter dated January 5, 2023 at GD2-8-9.\nFootnote 2\nSee sections 74.1(3) and (4) in the Canada Pension Plan Regulations.\nFootnote 3\nSee paragraph 18 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 4\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 5\nSee section 58.1 (c) in the Act.\nFootnote 6\nSee AD1.\nFootnote 7\nSee paragraphs 21 to 24 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 8\nSee paragraph 11 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 9\nSee Lee Villeneuve v Canada (Attorney General), 2013 FC 498.\n",

The General Division found that the issue before it was whether the Appellant, N. B. (Claimant), was late when he filed his appeal at the General Division.\n[3] The Claimant was trying to appeal a reconsideration decision of the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) dated April 27, 2023. He included a copy of this reconsideration decision in his Notice of Appeal.Footnote 1 But he also included another reconsideration decision, one dated January 7, 2021.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant was appealing the January 2021 reconsideration decision. So, it determined that when the Claimant filed his appeal on May 24, 2023, he was late by more than one year. As a result, the General Division concluded that \u201chis application for EI benefits [could] not be antedated (backdated)\u201dFootnote 2 because it was not brought on time.\n[5] The Claimant argues that the General Division made a jurisdictional and factual error in that it decided the wrong issue altogether.\n[6] The General Division identified the wrong issue, in part because it received an incomplete copy of the file materials from the Commission. This led the General Division to make jurisdictional, legal, and factual errors.\n[7] Ordinarily, the appropriate remedy would be to return the matter to the General Division for a redetermination. But the General Division already decided the matter on October 10, 2023, in a duplicate appeal that the Claimant filed.\n[8] The General Division cannot rehear the same thing because it already decided the matter. For this reason, I am dismissing the appeal.\nPreliminary matters [9] I recently held a case conference. I confirmed with the Claimant that he no longer wishes to have an in-person hearing and is agreeable to having this appeal proceed \u201cin writing.\u201d\nFactual background Reconsideration decision dated January 7, 2021 [10] The Commission issued a decision on January 7, 2021. The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider this decision. The Commission issued a reconsideration decision on January 21, 2021.Footnote 3 The January 21, 2021 reconsideration decision dealt with the issue of an antedating (backdating) of an application.\nReconsideration decision dated April 27, 2023 [11] The Commission issued another initial decision on November 21, 2022.Footnote 4 The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider this decision. The Commission issued a reconsideration decision on April 27, 2023.Footnote 5 The initial and reconsideration decision dealt with the issue of the Claimant\u2019s earnings and the allocation of those earnings.\n[12] The Commission found that the Claimant had misrepresented his earnings (though he subsequently voluntarily disclosed his earnings, so was not subject to any penalties). The April 27, 2023 decision also indicates that the Commission was reversing its decision on the issue of the allocation of the earnings.Footnote 6\n[13] The Claimant appealed this reconsideration decision twice, in two separate appeals to the General Division:\ni. GE-23-1437 \u2013 first appeal filed with General Division on May 24, 2023. The General Division issued its decision on October 10, 2023. The Claimant filed an appeal of the General Division decision to the Appeal Division on October 23, 2023 under appeal file number AD-23-982. ii. GE-23-1439 \u2013 second appeal filed with General Division, also on May 24, 2023. The General Division issued its decision on July 24, 2023. The Claimant filed an appeal of the General Division decision to the Appeal Division on July 31, 2023 under appeal file number AD-23-739. This is the matter before me.\n[14] These are duplicate appeals at the General Division. The Claimant is seeking or has sought to appeal the same reconsideration decision.\nIssues [15] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Did the General Division make any jurisdictional, legal, or factual errors? b) If so, how should the error be addressed?\nAnalysis [16] The Appeal Division may intervene in General Division decisions if the General Division made any jurisdictional, procedural, legal, or certain types of factual errors.Footnote 7\n[17] For these types of factual errors, the General Division had to have based its decision on that error, and had to have made the error in a perverse or capricious manner, or without regard for the evidence before it.Footnote 8\nThe General Division decided the wrong reconsideration decision [18] The General Division decided the wrong reconsideration decision. It should have been apparent to the General Division that the Claimant was appealing the reconsideration decision of April 27, 2023 and not the reconsideration decision dated January 7, 2021.\n[19] The Claimant included both reconsideration decisions with his Notice of Appeal. He also included other materials that related to the allocation of earnings and to a late application.\n[20] The Commission provided a copy of its file materials, which consisted of materials relating to the reconsideration decision of January 21, 2021. The file (GD3) included the Claimant`s application dated January 6, 2021, a record of employment dated July 9, 2021, an antedate request dated January 7, 2021, the Claimant`s request for reconsideration on the antedate issue, and the Commission`s reconsideration decision of January 21, 2021, dealing with the antedate issue.\n[21] Not surprisingly, the Commission\u2019s file led the General Division to believe that the Claimant\u2019s appeal related to the Commission\u2019s reconsideration decision of January 21, 2021, on the antedate issue.\n[22] However, the Claimant indicated in his Notice of Appeal which reconsideration decision he was appealing. The appeal form asked him when he received the reconsideration decision (that he was appealing). The Claimant clearly indicated that he received the reconsideration decision on April 27, 2023. Therefore, it should have alerted the General Division that the Claimant was appealing the reconsideration decision of April 27, 2023.\n[23] The General Division misapprehended the evidence (the Notice of Appeal). This led it to decide the wrong issue.\n[24] At the very least, since the Claimant had included both the 2021 and 2023 reconsideration decisions with his Notice of Appeal, the General Division should not have been reliant on the Commission\u2019s file. It should have sought clarification from the Claimant. It should have asked the Claimant which reconsideration decision he was appealing to the General Division.\nThe General Division made a jurisdictional and legal error by mixing two different issues [25] Although it is a moot concern since the General Division decided the wrong issue, I note that the General Division also made a legal error when it decided that it could not antedate the Claimant\u2019s application because of section 52(2) of the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD) Act.\n[26] Section 52(2) of the DESD Act lets the General Division extend the time within which an appeal to the General Division may be brought. It does not relate to whether a claimant can backdate their application for Employment Insurance benefits.\n[27] There were two succinct issues before the General Division:\ni. Whether the Claimant\u2019s appeal to the General Division had been filed on time. If not, could the General Division extend the time for filing the appeal. ii. Whether the Claimant could antedate (backdate) his application for employment Insurance benefits from January 6, 2021, to August 27, 2020.\n[28] The General Division mixed the two issues.\n[29] As the General Division had decided that the Claimant was late when he filed his appeal with the General Division, it should have concluded that it could not extend the time to allow him to file the appeal. That should have ended the matter.\n[30] At that point, the General Division did not have any jurisdiction to deal with the antedating issue.\n[31] If the Claimant had not been late by more than one year, at most, the General Division could have extended the time for filing. It still would not have had any jurisdiction to antedate a late appeal to the General Division.\nAddressing the error [32] The General Division decided the wrong reconsideration decision.\n[33] Usually, such an error would result in returning this matter to the General Division so that it can decide the matters (namely, the earnings and allocation issue) that it should have decided in the first place.\n[34] However, the General Division has decided the matter already.\n[35] As I have noted above, the Claimant filed duplicate appeals at the General Division. The General Division issued a decision on the appeal of the Commission\u2019s April 27, 2023 reconsideration decision (in file GE-23-1437) on October 10, 2023. The Claimant appealed the General Division\u2019s decision to the Appeal Division (AD-23-982). The Appeal Division did not grant leave (permission) for him to appeal.\n[36] The Claimant still wants to pursue an appeal of the Commission\u2019s April 27, 2023 reconsideration decision, under a duplicate appeal that he filed with the General Division. He claims that he was unaware that he filed two separate appeals.\n[37] But, the issues are the same and the parties to both proceedings are the same in both appeals. And, the General Division\u2019s decision on October 10, 2023, is final.\n[38] As the matters have already been decided by the General Division, it cannot rehear the appeal, even by a different member.Footnote 9 I see no utility in returning this matter to the General Division. The most judicious outcome is to dismiss this matter altogether.\nConclusion [39] The General Division (GE-23-1439) decided the wrong issue but it has already addressed the underlying issues in another appeal (GE-23-1437). For that reason, the appeal is dismissed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Notice of Appeal with reconsideration decision dated April 27, 2023, at GD 2-3.\nFootnote 2\nSee General Division at para 8.\nFootnote 3\nSee reconsideration decision dated January 21, 2021, at GD 2-18.\nFootnote 4\nSee initial decision dated November 21, 2022, at GD 2-12.\nFootnote 5\nSee reconsideration decision dated April 27, 2023, at GD 2-3.\nFootnote 6\nThe Commission did not provide the General Division with the second page of its November 21, 2022, decision, so I am unable to confirm what it decided initially on the allocation issue.\nFootnote 7\nSee section 58 (1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development (DESD) Act.\nFootnote 8\nSee section 58(1)(c) of the DESD Act.\nFootnote 9\nThis is the legal doctrine called res judicata.\n",

B.\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated August 2, 2023 (GE 22 4216)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nHearing date: January 9, 2024\nHearing participants: Appellant\u2019s representative Respondent\nDecision date: January 29, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-821\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue Analysis Remedy Conclusion\nDecision [1] The appeal is allowed.\nOverview [2] The Respondent (Claimant) works for a telecommunications company. He stopped working from June 6, 2021, to February 19, 2022, because he was on parental leave. During that period, he received Quebec Parental Insurance Plan benefits.\n[3] The Claimant then applied for Employment Insurance (EI) family caregiver benefits to support his mother. The Appellant (Commission) granted him 15 weeks of EI benefits, from February 20, 2022, to June 4, 2022.\n[4] On June 5, 2022, the Claimant applied for compassionate care benefits to be with his mother.\n[5] The Commission refused to pay him compassionate care benefits because it found that the Claimant did not have enough hours of insurable employment in the qualifying period, between June 6, 2021, and June 4, 2022.\n[6] The Claimant is asking the Commission to reconsider the decision. He argues that the benefit period should start on February 20, 2022, which is the start of his family caregiver benefit period, and that he could apply for another type of special benefit.\n[7] After reconsidering the decision on October 13, 2022, the Commission granted him compassionate care benefits. He could receive up to 26 weeks of compassionate care benefits as of June 5, 2022, at a rate of $595 per week.\n[8] On December 12, 2022, the Commission contacted the Claimant to tell him that it had to reverse its decision because of an error on its part. This meant that the Claimant had to repay all the compassionate care benefits. The Claimant appealed the reconsideration decision to the General Division.\n[9] The General Division found that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion when it decided to reconsider its own reconsideration decision. So, there was no need to decide whether the Claimant was entitled to compassionate care benefits.\n[10] Permission to appeal was granted to the Commission. It argues that the General Division made an error of law.\n[11] I have to decide whether the General Division made an error in finding that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion when it decided to reconsider its own reconsideration decision.\n[12] I am allowing the Commission\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [13] Did the General Division make an error when it found that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion when it decided to reconsider its own reconsideration decision?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [14] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[15] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[16] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, I must dismiss the appeal.\nDid the General Division make an error when it found that the Commission did not properly exercise its discretion when it decided to reconsider its own reconsideration decision? [17] The General Division found that the Commission did not exercise its discretion judicially when it decided to reconsider its own reconsideration decision.\n[18] The General Division also found that the Commission can only reconsider, under section 52 of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act), if an error that is unrelated to the decision being reviewed can be discovered.\n[19] In a case involving the application of section 52 of the EI Act, a claimant may have acted and received benefits in good faith when it is later discovered that they did not meet the criteria of the EI Act or were disentitled from receiving those benefits.\n[20] In the public interest, Parliament has provided for the reconsideration of benefit claims. But, in the interest of making fair and final decisions, it required that the reconsideration occur within 36 months of the time the benefits were paid or became payable.\n[21] Case law has established that the only limitation on the Commission\u2019s power to reconsider under section 52 of the EI Act is time.Footnote 2 This means that the Commission may reconsider a claim under section 52 even if there are no new facts.\n[22] In other words, the Commission can withdraw its earlier approval and require claimants to repay the benefits paid under that approval.\n[23] The power conferred by section 52 is not confined to the reconsideration of decisions, as such, but is an authority to reconsider \u201cany claim\u201d in respect of which benefits have been paid or should have been paid. The reconsideration of a claim is the reconsideration of the entitlement to benefits.Footnote 3\n[24] So, I am of the view that the General Division made an error of law when it found that the Commission could not withdraw its approval following a reconsideration decision in the Claimant\u2019s favour. It also made an error of law by determining that the Commission can only reconsider under section 52 if an error that is unrelated to the reconsideration decision is discovered.Footnote 4\n[25] The General Division also found that the Commission did not exercise its discretion judicially, since it simply told the Claimant that it had made an error in its reconsideration decision. It did not inform the Claimant of its process or its reasons for making a mistake.\n[26] I am of the view that the General Division based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\n[27] The reconsideration process under section 52 of the EI Act consists of four steps that must be completed within the time limits set out in the law: (i) the Commission must decide whether to exercise its discretion to reconsider; (ii) make the new decision; (iii) calculate the amount to be recovered or paid; and (iv) notify the claimant of the decision.\n[28] The evidence shows that the Commission granted the Claimant compassionate care benefits as of June 5, 2022. It decided to exercise its discretion to reconsider, made the new decision, calculated the amount to be paid, and notified the Claimant of the decision, orally and in writing, on December 12, 2022. A notice of debt was sent to him on December 17, 2022. The Commission met the 36-month deadline set out in the law.\n[29] The General Division also made an error by not making a decision on the Commission\u2019s refusal to extend the Claimant\u2019s benefit period and pay him compassionate care benefits.\n[30] I am therefore justified in intervening.\nRemedy [31] Because the file before the General Division is complete, I am able to give the decision that the General Division should have given.\n[32] Case law has established that the only limitation on the Commission\u2019s power to reconsider under section 52 of the EI Act is time. So, the Commission may reconsider a claim under section 52 even if there are no new facts.\n[33] The power conferred by section 52 is not confined to the reconsideration of decisions, as such, but is an authority to reconsider \u201cany claim\u201d in respect of which benefits have been paid or should have been paid. The reconsideration of a claim is the reconsideration of the entitlement to benefits.\n[34] The Commission granted the Claimant compassionate care benefits as of June 5, 2022. It decided to exercise its discretion to reconsider, made the new decision, calculated the amount to be paid, and notified the Claimant of the decision, orally and in writing, on December 12, 2022. A notice of debt was sent to him on December 17, 2022. So, the Commission met the 36-month deadline set out in the law.\n[35] However, the decision to reconsider a claim under section 52 is a discretionary one. This means that, although the Commission has the power to seek verification of entitlement or to reconsider a claim, it does not have to do so.\n[36] The law says that discretionary powers must be exercised judicially. This means that, when the Commission decides to reconsider a claim, it cannot act in bad faith or for an improper purpose or motive, consider an irrelevant factor, ignore a relevant factor, or act in a discriminatory manner.\n[37] The Commission has developed a policy to help it exercise its discretion to reconsider decisions under section 52 of the EI Act.\n[38] The Commission says the reason for the policy is \u201cto ensure a consistent and fair application of section 52 of the [EI Act] and to prevent creating debt when the claimant was overpaid through no fault of their own.\u201d The policy says that a claim will only be reconsidered when:\nbenefits have been underpaid benefits were paid contrary to the structure of the [EI Act] benefits were paid as a result of a false or misleading statement the Claimant ought to have known there was no entitlement to the benefits received\n[39] There is no doubt that the compassionate care benefits were paid to the Claimant contrary to the structure of the EI Act.Footnote 5\n[40] In my view, the Commission used its discretion judicially under section 52 of the EI Act. The Commission considered all relevant information when reconsidering the Claimant\u2019s claim. No new relevant facts were provided at the General Division hearing that the Claimant had not already provided to the Commission. There is no indication that the Commission considered any irrelevant information or acted in bad faith or in a discriminatory manner. The Commission also acted with a legitimate purpose in reconsidering the Claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits.\n[41] While I sympathize with the Claimant, the law does not allow for an extension of the benefit period or give the General Division or the Appeal Division the power to grant an extension of that period, regardless of the particular circumstances of a claimant\u2019s situation.Footnote 6\n[42] The Commission\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nConclusion [43] The appeal is allowed. The Commission used its discretion judicially, and extending the benefit period and paying compassionate care benefits was not possible.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nCanada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nBrisebois v Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), A-582-79; Bri\u00e8re v Canada (Employment and Immigration), A-637-86.\nFootnote 3\nSee, for example, Calder v M.E.I., (1980) 1 FC 842, A-233-79.\nFootnote 4\nThe Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles, Chapter 17 \u2013 Section 17.6.1.1 says that the Commission may also reconsider an error that is unrelated to the decision being reviewed. The Commission must then apply the reconsideration policy set out in section 17.3.3.\nFootnote 5\nSection 10(2) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act) says that a benefit period is 52 weeks. In this case, the 52nd week is the week ending June 4, 2022. So, the Claimant\u2019s last renewable week was the week of May 29, 2022, as required by section 10(8) of the EI Act. In this case, since the Claimant did not receive compassionate care benefits in his initial benefit period from June 6, 2021, to June 4, 2022, he was not entitled to an extension of the benefit period to start receiving compassionate care benefits beyond June 4, 2022.\nFootnote 6\nThe Claimant could apply to the Canada Revenue Agency to have the debt written off on the basis that the situation is causing him undue hardship.\n",

The Claimant had just cause for voluntarily leaving his job.\nOverview [2] The Appellant (Claimant) left his job on August 20, 2022, and applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. The Respondent (Commission) looked at the Claimant\u2019s reasons for leaving. It decided that he voluntarily left (or chose to quit) his job without just cause, so it was not able to pay him benefits.\n[3] The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider. It upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[4] The General Division found that the Claimant voluntarily left his job. It found that he had reasonable alternatives to leaving. It found that he could have contacted the CNESST [Quebec\u2019s labour standards commission] or talked to a lawyer or doctor before leaving his job. The General Division decided that he did not have just cause for voluntarily leaving his job.\n[5] The Claimant was given permission to appeal the General Division decision. He argues that the General Division ignored road safety laws and his history of depression in finding that he did not have just cause for leaving his job.\n[6] I have to decide whether the General Division based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, and whether it made an error in its interpretation of section 29(c) of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act).\n[7] I am allowing the Claimant\u2019s appeal.\nIssue [8] Did the General Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, and did it make an error in its interpretation of section 29(c) of the EI Act?\nAnalysis Appeal Division\u2019s mandate [9] The Federal Court of Appeal has established that the Appeal Division\u2019s mandate is conferred to it by sections 55 to 69 of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.Footnote 1\n[10] The Appeal Division acts as an administrative appeal tribunal for decisions made by the General Division and does not exercise a superintending power similar to that exercised by a higher court.\n[11] So, unless the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice, made an error of law, or based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, the Tribunal must dismiss the appeal.\nPreliminary remarks [12] It is well established that I have to consider only the evidence that was before the General Division. This is because a hearing before the Appeal Division is not a new opportunity to present evidence. The powers of the Appeal Division are limited by law.Footnote 2\nDid the General Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, and did it make an error in its interpretation of section 29(c) of the EI Act? [13] The Claimant argues that the General Division ignored road safety laws and his history of depression in finding that he did not have just cause for leaving his job.\n[14] The Claimant argues that his employer was putting his safety at risk by not making the necessary repairs to his delivery truck. He says that the truck should not have been allowed on the road. Despite an ultimatum to the employer, there were still repairs to be done when he left.\n[15] The General Division had to decide whether the Claimant had just cause for voluntarily leaving his job when he did.\n[16] Just cause for voluntarily leaving a job exists if the claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving, considering all the circumstances.\n[17] The General Division found that the Claimant left his job. The evidence shows that his employment did end when he stopped showing up for work.\n[18] The Claimant explained that his 40-foot truck was unsafe. He had to repeatedly ask his employer to fix it. He eventually sent his employer an ultimatum email.\n[19] This July 14, 2022, email contained a list of requested repairs the employer had to make. The Claimant indicated that, for his own safety, he would not be making deliveries with the vehicle anymore if the repairs were not done.\n[20] The employer confirmed to the Commission that the truck had to be repaired. The Claimant explained that the truck was not fully repaired after his ultimatum, since there was still the matter of the tires and the truck\u2019s nighttime lights.\n[21] The General Division found that it would have been reasonable for the Claimant to contact the CNESST or a lawyer about his working conditions. It found that he could have gotten a medical certificate before leaving his job.\n[22] I am of the view that the General Division made its decision without regard for the material before it and that it made an error of law in its interpretation of section 29(c) of the EI Act.\n[23] The evidence shows that, after getting an ultimatum, the employer had still not fixed the nighttime lights on the 40-foot truck, except for the flashers. There was still a problem with the tires that kept deflating. Even though the Claimant\u2019s truck did not meet basic safety requirements, the employer insisted that he drive it.\n[24] This version of events from the Claimant is uncontradicted, since the employer did not return the Commission\u2019s calls.\n[25] The Highway Safety Code (HSC) says that an owner may not allow a vehicle that has a major defect to be operated.Footnote 3 Also, under the HSC, the Claimant could not legally drive a heavy vehicle that had a major defect.Footnote 4\n[26] It is easy to conclude that a 40-foot heavy vehicle has a major defect if its lights do not work at night and that allowing such a vehicle to be operated endangered the Claimant\u2019s safety and that of others.\n[27] The evidence shows, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant left his job because of the employer\u2019s practices that were contrary to law and because his working conditions were a danger to his safety.Footnote 5\n[28] I find that it was unreasonable for the General Division to expect the Claimant to contact the CNESST or a lawyer about his working conditions before leaving, since the evidence clearly shows that the employer was running its business while completely ignoring all the problems the Claimant had repeatedly raised and while deliberately disregarding legal requirements in terms of road safety.\n[29] This means that I am justified in intervening.\nRemedy [30] Considering that the parties had the opportunity to present their case before the General Division, I will give the decision that the General Division should have given.Footnote 6\n[31] A claimant has the burden of proving that they had no reasonable alternative to leaving their job considering all the circumstances of their case, not that their only option was to quit.\n[32] In this case, the evidence shows, on a balance of probabilities, that the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job because of his employer\u2019s unlawful practices that put his safety at risk.\n[33] The evidence shows that the Claimant tried everything to save his job. He repeatedly discussed the poor condition of his truck with his employer before finally leaving his job.\n[34] The employer was not following the law and had no immediate intention of changing its working conditions, even after getting an ultimatum. It insisted that the Claimant get back on the road knowing that the 40-foot truck\u2019s nighttime lights were defective and that the tires were unsafe.\n[35] The Claimant had to work irregular hours and could be asked to work short shifts at any time. He did not have time to apply for a job or attend an interview. He had no time for himself because he remained available any time for deliveries. His job kept him very busy, and he had to be available for his employer seven days a week. He also did not need to get a medical certificate, since he recognized some depressive symptoms and was proactive to avoid sinking into another depression.\n[36] I find that asking the Claimant to continue working for that employer under such conditions is contrary to the requirements of section 29(c) of the EI Act.\n[37] For the reasons I mentioned, the Claimant\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\nConclusion [38] The appeal is allowed. The Claimant had just cause for voluntarily leaving his job.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee Canada (Attorney General) v Jean, 2015 FCA 242; and Maunder v Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 274.\nFootnote 2\nSee Sibbald v Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 157.\nFootnote 3\nSee section 519.17 of Quebec\u2019s Highway Safety Code.\nFootnote 4\nSee section 519.6 of Quebec\u2019s Highway Safety Code.\nFootnote 5\nSee sections 29(c)(iv) and (xi) of the Employment Insurance Act.\nFootnote 6\nAs per section 59(1) of the Department of Employment and Social Development Act.\n",

B.\nRespondent: Minister of Employment and Social Development\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated November 28, 2023 (GP-23-967)\nTribunal member: Kate Sellar\nDecision date: January 30, 2024\nFile number: AD-24-90\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issue I\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\nDecision [1] I\u2019m refusing to give the Claimant leave (permission) to appeal. The appeal will not proceed. These are the reasons for my decision.\nOverview [2] L. B. (Claimant) had two workplace accidents. She applied for a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability pension in 2005. The Minister of Employment and Social Development (Minister) refused her application. She appealed to the Review Tribunal (as it was called then). After a hearing, the Review Tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal in 2008, finding that she wasn\u2019t eligible for the disability pension. The Claimant didn\u2019t appeal.\n[3] In April 2022, the Clamant applied for CPP disability benefits again. She explained that she had been unable to work since 2005 because of her disability. The Minister refused her application initially and in a reconsideration letter. The Claimant appealed to this Tribunal.\n[4] The General Division dismissed the Claimant\u2019s appeal. The General Division applied the rule against deciding something that has already been decided. In Latin, that rule is called res judicata.\nIssue [5] The issues in this appeal are:\na) Has the Claimant raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring her medical evidence? b) Does the application set out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division?\nI\u2019m not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [6] I can give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application raises an arguable case that the General Division:\ndidn\u2019t follow a fair process; acted beyond its powers or refused to exercise those powers; made an error of law; made an error of fact; or made an error applying the law to the facts.Footnote 1\n[7] I can also give the Claimant permission to appeal if the application sets out evidence that wasn\u2019t presented to the General Division.Footnote 2\n[8] Since the Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case and hasn\u2019t set out new evidence that would justify granting permission to appeal, I must refuse permission to appeal.\nThere\u2019s no arguable case that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring the Claimant\u2019s medical evidence. [9] The Claimant argues that the General Division made an error of fact by ignoring her medical evidence, especially recent medical reports (including an x-ray and MRI results). She explains that she has unresolved pain that was caused by the workplace injury. The pain has worsened over time.Footnote 3\n[10] The General Division did discuss both an imaging report from August 2021 and the Claimant\u2019s MRI from August 2023.Footnote 4\n[11] However, the General Division found that these reports didn\u2019t help the Claimant to show that the 2008 hearing at the Review Tribunal was unfair.Footnote 5\n[12] I cannot conclude that the General Division ignored these reports. I understand that the Claimant wanted the new reports to form the basis for hearing her appeal for the disability pension. However, the General Division applied the law against hearing a matter that has already been heard. The reports didn\u2019t change the outcome of that analysis. The Claimant hasn\u2019t raised an arguable case that the General Division made an error in its discussion of these reports.\n[13] The Claimant also provided some medical documents to the General Division on November 19, 2024, just after the hearing.Footnote 6 The General Division wrote to the Claimant, explaining that it wouldn\u2019t consider the late evidence because it wasn\u2019t relevant to the question of whether the General Division should apply the rule against deciding something that\u2019s already been decided.Footnote 7 Refusing to consider these late reports is different from making an error of fact by ignoring them. Again, the General Division explained that they weren\u2019t relevant to the issue it had to resolve.Footnote 8\nNo new evidence that would justify granting permission to appeal [14] The Claimant attached some medical documents to her application to the Appeal Division. The Claimant already presented almost all these reports to the General Division.Footnote 9 The report that I believe the Claimant hadn\u2019t already presented to the General Division is the MRI report of the Claimant\u2019s right shoulder from 2022.Footnote 10\n[15] The MRI report from 2022 isn\u2019t relevant to the issue I need to resolve in this decision. I must decide whether the General Division may have made an error in its decision applying the rule against deciding something that has already been decided.\n[16] The Review Tribunal decided in 2008 that the Claimant\u2019s disability wasn\u2019t severe within the meaning of the CPP on or before the end of her coverage period in 2007. There\u2019s nothing about the 2022 MRI report that is relevant to the question of whether the General Division made an error in its decision. The General Division was only deciding about whether it could hear again the same issue the Review Tribunal already heard and decided. This 2022 MRI report is from many years after the end of the Claimant\u2019s coverage period. It is also dated long after the Review Tribunal\u2019s decision about the Claimant\u2019s disability during her coverage period.\n[17] Since the report isn\u2019t relevant to the question of whether the General Division might have made an error, it cannot form the basis for permission to appeal.\n[18] I\u2019ve reviewed the record in this appeal.Footnote 11 I\u2019m satisfied that the General Division didn\u2019t ignore or misunderstand the evidence when it decided not to hear the same issue the Review Tribunal already decided. The General Division considered and applied the available evidence to the law about deciding questions that have already been decided.Footnote 12 The General Division also considered in detail whether applying the rule against deciding something that has already been decided would result in an injustice.\nConclusion [19] I\u2019ve refused to give the Claimant permission to appeal. This means that the appeal won\u2019t proceed.\nFootnotes\nFootnote 1\nSee section 58.1(a) and (b) in the Department of Employment and Social Development Act (Act).\nFootnote 2\nSee section 58.1(c) of the Act.\nFootnote 3\nSee AD1-4.\nFootnote 4\nSee paragraphs 29 to 31 in the General Division decision, discussing documents at GD2-187, GD2-180, GD6-2, and GD2-183 and 186.\nFootnote 5\nSee paragraphs 29 to 32 in the General Division decision.\nFootnote 6\nSee GD7.\nFootnote 7\nSee GD8.\nFootnote 8\nI\u2019ve considered whether refusing to accept these late reports raises any other possible error that would justify giving the Claimant permission to appeal. I cannot conclude that the General Division failed to provide the Claimant with a fair process here, given that the General Division considered whether the reports were relevant and then issued its reasons for not considering them.\nFootnote 9\nThe Claimant provided the Appeal Division with copies of the reports that were already available to the General Division at GD2-180, GD6-2, GD2-202, GD2-215, and GD2-287. The Claimant also provided a copy of GD7-4, which the General Division decided not to consider in its decision at GD8.\nFootnote 10\nSee AD1-15.\nFootnote 11\nThe Federal Court explained the Appeal Division\u2019s role in performing this kind of review in Karadeolian v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 615.\nFootnote 12\nSee paragraphs 18 to 22 in the General Division decision considering the pre-conditions for applying the rule against deciding something that\u2019s already been decided. Paragraphs 26 to 39 explain how the General Division concluded that applying the rule wouldn\u2019t cause injustice.\n",

C.\nRespondent: Canada Employment Insurance Commission\nRepresentative: Jos\u00e9e Lachance\nDecision under appeal: General Division decision dated October 27, 2023 (GE-23-1053)\nTribunal member: Pierre Lafontaine\nType of hearing: Teleconference\nDecision date: January 31, 2024\nFile number: AD-23-991\nOn this page\nDecision Overview Issues Analysis Conclusion\nDecision [1] Permission to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed.\nOverview [2] From October 22, 2018, to May 17, 2022, inclusive, the Applicant (Claimant) worked as a maintenance worker for a hospital and stopped working for that employer. After that period of employment, the Claimant worked for two other employers.\n[3] On November 6, 2022, the Claimant applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. A benefit period was established effective November 6, 2022.\n[4] On January 12, 2023, the Respondent (Commission) told him that it did not accept the hours worked for the hospital because he voluntarily left his job with that employer without good cause within the meaning of the law. It disqualified him from receiving benefits from May 15, 2022.\n[5] The Claimant asked the Commission to reconsider its decision but the Commission upheld its initial decision. The Claimant appealed to the General Division.\n[6] The General Division proceeded with the hearing in the Claimant\u2019s absence. It found that the Claimant did not have just cause for voluntarily leaving his job because he had reasonable alternatives to leaving. The General Division upheld the Claimant\u2019s disqualification effective May 15, 2022.\n[7] In support of his application for permission to appeal, the Claimant argues that he tried to join the hearing but that nobody answered. He would like the opportunity to dispute his former employer\u2019s story.\nIssues [8] Should permission to appeal be granted?\n[9] Did the General Division fail to observe a principle of natural justice?\nAnalysis [10] After reviewing the file, I decided to hold a settlement conference. The Claimant explained his efforts to attend the General Division hearing. He waited but did not get an answer. As soon as he received the General Division decision, he filed his application for permission to appeal.\n[11] The Commission did not find any reason to doubt the Claimant\u2019s version of events. It agrees that he did not have an opportunity to be heard and that there was a breach of natural justice.\n[12] The concept of \u201cnatural justice\u201d includes the Claimant\u2019s right to a fair hearing. A fair hearing assumes the opportunity to be heard, the right to know what is being alleged against the party, and the opportunity to respond to those allegations.\n[13] I acknowledge the General Division\u2019s efforts to make it possible for the Claimant to attend the hearing. I am still of the view that there was a breach of natural justice.\n[14] For these reasons, permission to appeal is granted and the Claimant\u2019s appeal is allowed.\nConclusion [15] Permission to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. The file returns to the General Division for reconsideration.\n",

Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec le prestataire.\n[2] La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada a prouv\u00e9 que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 administratif sans solde (suspendu) en raison d\u2019une inconduite (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire parce qu\u2019il a fait quelque chose qui lui a fait perdre son emploi). Par cons\u00e9quent, le prestataire est exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 1.\nAper\u00e7u [3] Le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde. Son employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 la politique de vaccination : il ne s\u2019est pas fait vacciner.\n[4] M\u00eame si le prestataire ne conteste pas que cela s\u2019est produit, il affirme que ne pas respecter la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur n\u2019est pas une inconduite. Il soutient \u00e9galement que parce qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 des prestations de maladie, il devrait \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[5] La Commission a accept\u00e9 la raison du cong\u00e9diement que l\u2019employeur a fournie. Elle a estim\u00e9 que le prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Elle a donc conclu que le prestataire est exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\nQuestion en litige [6] Le prestataire a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde en raison d\u2019une inconduite?\nAnalyse [7] La loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une personne ne peut pas recevoir de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi si elle perd son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Cela s\u2019applique si son employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e ou suspendueNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] Pour d\u00e9cider si le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu en raison d\u2019une inconduite, je dois examiner deux choses. D\u2019abord, je dois d\u00e9cider pour quelle raison il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. Ensuite, je dois d\u00e9cider si la loi consid\u00e8re cette raison comme une inconduite.\nPourquoi le prestataire a-t-il perdu son emploi? [9] Je conclus que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur.\n[10] Le prestataire et la Commission ne sont pas en d\u00e9saccord sur la raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu. Les deux conviennent qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas fait vacciner.\n[11] Je conclus que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde parce qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur. Il n\u2019y a aucun doute \u00e0 ce sujet. Le prestataire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voulait pas suivre la politique et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019exemption. Il a dit qu\u2019il connaissait le contenu de la politique et les cons\u00e9quences de ne pas la respecter.\nLa raison du cong\u00e9diement du prestataire est-elle une inconduite au sens de la loi? [12] La raison du cong\u00e9diement du prestataire est une inconduite au sens de la loi.\n[13] La Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi ne pr\u00e9cise pas ce qu\u2019est une inconduite. Cependant, la jurisprudence (l\u2019ensemble des d\u00e9cisions que les tribunaux ont rendues) aide \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la suspension du prestataire r\u00e9sulte d\u2019une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit le crit\u00e8re juridique de l\u2019inconduite, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire les questions et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration quand on examine la question de l\u2019inconduite.\n[14] Selon la jurisprudence, pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduite, la conduite doit \u00eatre d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Cela signifie que la conduite est consciente, voulue ou intentionnelleNote de bas de page 3. L\u2019inconduite comprend aussi une conduite qui est si insouciante qu\u2019elle est presque d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9eNote de bas de page 4. Pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduite au sens de la loi, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le prestataire ait eu une intention coupable (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il ait voulu faire quelque chose de mal)Note de bas de page 5.\n[15] Il y a inconduite si le prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que sa conduite pouvait l\u2019emp\u00eacher de remplir ses obligations envers son employeur et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement possible qu\u2019il soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour cette raisonNote de bas de page 6.\n[16] Je peux seulement trancher les questions auxquelles la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011emploi s\u2019applique. Je ne peux pas d\u00e9cider si d\u2019autres lois offrent d\u2019autres options au prestataire. Il ne m\u2019appartient pas non plus de d\u00e9cider si son employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 injustement ou s\u2019il aurait d\u00fb lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnablesNote de bas de page 7. Je peux seulement \u00e9valuer si ce que le prestataire a fait ou n\u2019a pas fait est une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[17] Dans une d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale intitul\u00e9e McNamara, le prestataire a soutenu qu\u2019il devrait recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi parce que son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 injustementNote de bas de page 8. Il avait perdu son emploi en raison de la politique de son employeur sur le d\u00e9pistage des drogues. Il a fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9, puisque le test de d\u00e9pistage n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 dans les circonstances. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun motif raisonnable ne permettait de croire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir consomm\u00e9 de la drogue. De plus, les r\u00e9sultats de son dernier test de d\u00e9pistage auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre valides.\n[18] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9pondu en faisant remarquer qu\u2019elle avait toujours affirm\u00e9 que, dans les dossiers d\u2019inconduite, la question \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019action ou l\u2019omission de la personne employ\u00e9e constituait une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, et non si la personne employ\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e injustementNote de bas de page 9.\n[19] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a aussi dit que lorsqu\u2019on interpr\u00e8te et applique la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, il faut se concentrer sur le comportement de la personne employ\u00e9e, et non sur celui de l\u2019employeur. Elle a aussi fait remarquer que les personnes employ\u00e9es qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9es injustement ont d\u2019autres solutions \u00e0 leur disposition. Ces solutions p\u00e9nalisent le comportement de l\u2019employeur et \u00e9vitent que celui-ci co\u00fbte de l\u2019argent aux contribuables en versements de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploiNote de bas de page 10.\n[20] Dans une affaire plus r\u00e9cente intitul\u00e9e Paradis, le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 un test de d\u00e9pistageNote de bas de page 11. Il a fait valoir qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 injustement parce que les r\u00e9sultats du test montraient qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas travaill\u00e9 avec les facult\u00e9s affaiblies. Il a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur aurait d\u00fb lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses politiques et \u00e0 la loi provinciale sur les droits de la personne. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision McNamara et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le comportement de l\u2019employeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinent pour \u00e9valuer s\u2019il y avait eu inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 12.\n[21] Dans une autre affaire semblable intitul\u00e9e Mishibinijima, le prestataire a perdu son emploi en raison de son alcoolismeNote de bas de page 13. Il a soutenu que son employeur devait lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation parce que l\u2019alcoolisme est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une d\u00e9ficience. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a encore une fois affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il fallait se concentrer sur ce que la personne employ\u00e9e a fait ou n\u2019a pas fait et qu\u2019il importe peu que l\u2019employeur lui ait offert ou non des mesures d\u2019adaptationNote de bas de page 14.\n[22] Ces d\u00e9cisions ne concernant pas des politiques de vaccination contre la COVID-19, mais ce qu\u2019elles disent est pertinent. Mon r\u00f4le n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00e9valuer le comportement ou les politiques de l\u2019employeur et d\u2019\u00e9tablir s\u2019il a eu raison de suspendre le prestataire. Je dois plut\u00f4t me concentrer sur ce que celui-ci a fait ou n\u2019a pas fait et voir si cela constitue une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[23] La Commission affirme qu\u2019il y a eu inconduite parce que le prestataire a refus\u00e9 de se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Il l\u2019a fait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment en sachant qu\u2019il serait suspendu sans solde. La Commission convient qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u des prestations de maladie, mais cela ne lui donne pas droit \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux deux types de prestations sont diff\u00e9rents. Le refus du prestataire de suivre la politique constitue une inconduite et c\u2019est pour cela qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 des prestations.\n[24] Le prestataire soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019inconduite parce que la politique de l\u2019employeur violait les codes internationaux ainsi que ses droits. Il savait qu\u2019il pouvait demander une exemption pour des raisons religieuses, mais il n\u2019en a pas demand\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il connaissait d\u2019autres personnes qui l\u2019avaient fait sans succ\u00e8s.\n[25] La politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur pr\u00e9voit que tous les membres du personnel doivent attester qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vaccin\u00e9s avant le 14 novembre 2021. Les personnes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas vaccin\u00e9es \u00e0 cette date seraient mises en cong\u00e9 administratif sans solde \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elles aient demand\u00e9 et obtenu une exemption. La politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e au prestataire le 6 octobre 2021. Le fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de la politique est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important du crit\u00e8re d\u2019inconduite.\n[26] Le prestataire savait ce que la politique de vaccination exigeait de lui et ce qui se passerait s\u2019il ne la respectait pas. Le 6 octobre 2021, l\u2019employeur l\u2019a inform\u00e9 des exigences de la politique et des cons\u00e9quences de ne pas les respecter. Le prestataire ne conteste pas ce fait.\n[27] Je conclus que la Commission a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a eu inconduite parce que les deux parties conviennent qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de suivre la politique de l\u2019employeur. La preuve montre clairement que le prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la politique et qu\u2019il connaissait ses exigences et les cons\u00e9quences de ne pas les respecter. Il savait qu\u2019il serait mis en cong\u00e9 administratif sans solde s\u2019il n\u2019obtenait pas d\u2019exemption. Sachant cela, il a refus\u00e9 de suivre la politique. La Commission a raison de dire que les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations de maladie et aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi sont diff\u00e9rents.\nLe prestataire a-t-il donc \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu en raison d\u2019une inconduite? [28] Selon mes conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, je juge que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\n[29] Il en est ainsi parce que ses actions ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 sa suspension. Il a agi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment. Il savait qu\u2019il risquait d\u2019\u00eatre mis en cong\u00e9 administratif sans solde s\u2019il refusait de se faire vacciner.\nConclusion [30] La Commission a prouv\u00e9 que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Le prestataire est donc exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nL\u2019article 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une partie prestataire qui perd son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir les articles 30 et 31 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Mishibinijima c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la d\u00e9cision McKay-Eden c Sa Majest\u00e9 La Reine, A-402-96.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c Secours, A-352-94.\nNote de bas de page 6\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Mishibinijina c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36.\nNote de bas de page 7\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c McNamara, 2007 CAF 107.\nNote de bas de page 8\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c McNamara, 2007 CAF 107.\nNote de bas de page 9\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c McNamara, 2007 CAF 107 au paragraphe 22.\nNote de bas de page 10\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c McNamara, 2007 CAF 107 au paragraphe 23.\nNote de bas de page 11\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Paradis c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CF 1282.\nNote de bas de page 12\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Paradis c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2016 CAF 1282 au paragraphe 31.\nNote de bas de page 13\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Mishibinijima c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36.\nNote de bas de page 14\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Mishibinijima c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36.\n",

Le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[3] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait retourner au travail et qu\u2019il a fait des d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi convenable.

[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait retourner au travail et qu\u2019il a fait des d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi convenable puisqu\u2019il ne recherchait pas un autre emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a \u00e9tabli une condition personnelle qui limite ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler en attendant le rappel de son employeur. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible \u00e0 travailler.\n[12] Le prestataire fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il travaille \u00e0 temps partiel et qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied temporairement. Il soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la jurisprudence de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui indique qu\u2019un prestataire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9 avec la promesse d\u2019\u00eatre rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 une date pr\u00e9cise peut, pendant une p\u00e9riode raisonnable, consid\u00e9rer le rappel promis comme \u00e9tant la meilleure possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, et donc agir en cons\u00e9quence.\n[13] En tenant compte de la jurisprudence soumise par le prestataire, la Commission est d\u2019accord qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que le prestataire aurait d\u00fb se voir octroyer un d\u00e9lai raisonnable lors de sa mise \u00e0 pied du 23 d\u00e9cembre 2022 alors qu\u2019il connaissait sa date de retour \u00e0 son emploi, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il a effectivement repris le travail \u00e0 compter de cette date. Cons\u00e9quemment, la Commission soumet qu\u2019elle conc\u00e8de l\u2019appel sur la question en litige et demande que la division d\u2019appel accueille l\u2019appel du prestataire.\n[14] Je constate qu\u2019il existe une jurisprudence qui \u00e9tablit qu\u2019un prestataire ne peut se contenter d'attendre d'\u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail et qu\u2019il doit se chercher du travail pour avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations, peu importe ses chances de succ\u00e8s.Note de bas de page 2\n[15] Cependant, dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, celle-ci nous instruit qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune r\u00e8gle absolue qui obligerait en toutes circonstances les prestataires \u00e0 entreprendre sur-le-champ une recherche d\u2019emploi. Il y a lieu dans certaines circonstances d\u2019accorder aux prestataires un d\u00e9lai raisonnable avant le d\u00e9but de la recherche d\u2019emplois pour voir s\u2019ils seront rappel\u00e9s au travail.Note de bas de page 3\n[16] En d\u2019autres mots, dans certaines circonstances, le prestataire peut, pendant un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, consid\u00e9rerla promesse de rappel au travail comme le moyen le plus probable d'obtenir de nouveau un emploi et agir en cons\u00e9quence.\n[17] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied par son employeur pour lequel il travaille depuis sept ans. Il est disponible \u00e0 travailler en tout temps pour son employeur pendant sa p\u00e9riode de prestations si son employeur lui demande.\n[18] La preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 en ch\u00f4mage pour des raisons hors de son contr\u00f4le et qu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la promesse de rappel au travail comme le moyen le plus probable d'obtenir de nouveau un emploi.\n[19] Pour ces motifs, je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en droit et rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance.\n[20] Je suis donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir.\nRem\u00e8de [21] Le dossier devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tant complet, je suis en mesures de rendre la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[22] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire \u00e9tait pr\u00eat et disponible \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 partir du 26 d\u00e9cembre 2022. Il s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9 en ch\u00f4mage pour des raisons hors de son contr\u00f4le. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler pour son employeur sur demande. La promesse de rappel au travail \u00e9tait pour lui le moyen le plus probable d'obtenir de nouveau un emploi et il a agi en cons\u00e9quence.\n[23] Le prestataire aurait d\u00fb se voir octroyer un d\u00e9lai raisonnable lors de sa mise \u00e0 pied du 23 d\u00e9cembre 2022, alors qu\u2019il connaissait la date de retour \u00e0 son emploi.\n[24] Il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel du prestataire.\nConclusion [25] L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Jean, 2015 CAF 242; Maunder c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 274.\nNote de bas de page 2\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Comelissen-O'Neil, A-652-93, Faucher c Canada (EIC), A-56-96, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Cloutier, 2005 CAF 73, Lamirande c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2004 CAF 311, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Stolniuk, A-686-93, CUB 76450, CUB 69221, CUB 64656, CUB 52936, CUB 35563.\nNote de bas de page 3\nPage c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 169.\n",

Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler pendant sa formation \u00e0 temps plein. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations. La prestataire a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les ressources humaines de l\u2019employeur \u00e0 Ottawa avaient dirig\u00e9 la prestataire vers un transfert et initi\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches avec l\u2019employeur en faveur de la prestataire. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019intention de la prestataire n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de quitter son emploi, mais plut\u00f4t de transf\u00e9rer vers une autre filiale de l\u2019employeur, un transfert encourag\u00e9 et guid\u00e9 par les ressources humaines. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que la prestataire \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 travailler au sens de la loi. La Commission a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devant la division d\u2019appel.\nEn s\u2019appuyant sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Page c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2023 CAF 169, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 travailler au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi m\u00eame si elle suivait une formation \u00e0 temps plein. Cependant, la division d\u2019appel a conclu que selon la preuve et contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Page, la prestataire \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler seulement les week-ends et quelques heures par semaine pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Elle consacrait 42 heures par semaine \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes. La division d\u2019appel a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance et qu\u2019elle a err\u00e9 en droit.

La prestataire n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler pendant sa formation \u00e0 temps plein.\nAper\u00e7u [2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e (prestataire) a demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. L\u2019appelante (Commission) a examin\u00e9 le dossier de la prestataire. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette derni\u00e8re a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle a choisi de quitter son emploi) sans justification pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Elle a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler pendant sa formation \u00e0 temps plein. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations.\n[3] La prestataire a soutenu qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle avait re\u00e7u l\u2019assurance d\u2019un transfert Ottawa-Sudbury par les ressources humaines de son employeur. Elle a fait valoir \u00eatre disponible \u00e0 travailler pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision, la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. La prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les ressources humaines d\u2019Ottawa l\u2019avaient dirig\u00e9 vers un transfert et initi\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches avec X-Sudbury en faveur de la prestataire. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019intention de la prestataire n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de quitter son emploi, mais plut\u00f4t de transf\u00e9rer vers une autre filiale de X, un transfert encourag\u00e9 et guid\u00e9 par les ressources humaines. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que la prestaire \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 travailler au sens de la loi.\n[5] Le Commission a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance et qu\u2019elle a err\u00e9 en droit.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation des articles 18(1)(a) et 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE).\n[7] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel de la Commission sur la question de disponibilit\u00e9.\nQuestions en litige [8] Est-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation des articles 18(1)(a) et 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE?\nAnalyse Mandat de la division d\u2019appel [9] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la division d\u2019appel n\u2019avait d\u2019autre mandat que celui qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par les articles 55 \u00e0 69 de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.Note de bas de page 1\n[10] La division d\u2019appel agit \u00e0 titre de tribunal administratif d\u2019appel eu \u00e9gard aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et n\u2019exerce pas un pouvoir de surveillance de la nature de celui qu\u2019exerce une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[11] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'ait pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, qu'elle ait err\u00e9 en droit ou qu'elle ait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, le Tribunal doit rejeter l'appel.\nRemarques pr\u00e9liminaires [12] J'ai proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9coute de l'enregistrement de l'audience devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de trancher cet appel.\n[13] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que je dois prendre en consid\u00e9ration que la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. En effet, une audience devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une nouvelle opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Les pouvoirs de la division d\u2019appel sont limit\u00e9s par la loi.Note de bas de page 2\nEst-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation des articles 18(1)(a) et 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE? D\u00e9part volontaire [14] La Commission fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en droit parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si la prestataire avait bel et bien quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi.\n[15] Il incombait \u00e0 la Commission de prouver devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi.\n[16] La prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de concert avec son employeur d\u2019entreprendre des \u00e9tudes pour augmenter ses comp\u00e9tences. La prestataire travaillait comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire depuis juillet 2018 pour l\u2019employeur X, \u00e0 sa succursale d\u2019Ottawa. Souhaitant suivre une formation en technique d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e \u00e0 Sudbury, la prestataire a demand\u00e9 un transfert \u00e0 la succursale de Sudbury.\n[17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cr\u00e9dible le t\u00e9moignage de la prestataire.\n[18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les ressources humaines d\u2019Ottawa l\u2019avaient effectivement dirig\u00e9 vers un transfert et initi\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches avec X-Sudbury en faveur de la prestataire.\n[19] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019intention de la prestataire n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 de quitter son emploi, mais plut\u00f4t de transf\u00e9rer vers une autre filiale de X, un transfert encourag\u00e9 et guid\u00e9 par les ressources humaines.\n[20] L\u2019employeur a fait valoir aupr\u00e8s de la Commission qu\u2019en raison des diff\u00e9rents districts, l\u2019employ\u00e9 devait quitter son emploi et postuler au nouvel emplacement du district, comme n\u2019importe quel candidat du public.\n[21] Pourtant, le contrat d\u2019emploi de la prestataire ne supporte pas cette pr\u00e9tention. Il indique que la prestataire est engag\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur X. La prestataire est affect\u00e9e \u00e0 la succursale d\u2019Ottawa.Note de bas de page 3 Le contrat de travail donne du poids \u00e0 la version de la prestataire que l\u2019employeur l\u2019a plut\u00f4t dirig\u00e9 vers un transfert et initi\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches \u00e0 cet effet avec la succursale de Sudbury.\n[22] Tel que d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable pour la prestataire d\u2019accorder foi aux propos tenus par les ressources humaines d\u2019Ottawa \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019elle ferait l\u2019objet d\u2019un transfert de succursale.\n[23] La jurisprudence est depuis longtemps constante \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019\u00e0 moins de circonstances particuli\u00e8res \u00e9videntes, la question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 doit d'abord \u00eatre laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui est mieux en mesure d\u2019en d\u00e9cider. Je ne trouve aucune raison d\u2019intervenir sur la question de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la prestataire, telle qu\u2019\u00e9valu\u00e9e par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[24] La preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante ne d\u00e9montre pas que la prestataire a initi\u00e9 la fin de son emploi. La Commission n\u2019a pas rempli son fardeau de preuve.\n[25] Une fois \u00e9tabli que la d\u00e9part de la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas volontaire, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables.\n[26] Ce moyen d\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nDisponibilit\u00e9 [27] La Commission fait valoir que la conclusion de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, s\u2019il y en a une, n\u2019est pas support\u00e9e par une analyse concr\u00e8te de cette disponibilit\u00e9 en vertu des facteurs \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence et la l\u00e9gislation puisque la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne fait ni mention de l\u2019article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE ni de la jurisprudence existante pour appuyer son argument que la prestataire \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 travailler.\n[28] Il est vrai que la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019est pas un exemple de clart\u00e9. N\u00e9anmoins, il en ressort certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui d\u00e9montre que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a effectivement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la loi et les crit\u00e8res pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019affaire Faucher.Note de bas de page 4\n[29] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les plages horaires propos\u00e9es par la prestataire d\u00e9montraient sa disponibilit\u00e9 et convenaient \u00e0 un horaire de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. Elle a retenu que la prestataire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en audience avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 18 octobre 2022, pour la compagnie X de Sudbury, ce qui \u00e0 son point de vue annulait la pr\u00e9somption qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas travailler ou n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tudiait \u00e0 temps plein en technique d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e.\n[30] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le type de travail effectu\u00e9 par la prestataire lui permettait de suivre son cours \u00e0 plein temps. Elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la prestataire avait travaill\u00e9 sur des horaires irr\u00e9guliers depuis quatre ann\u00e9es et effectu\u00e9 beaucoup de temps suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[31] En s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019affaire r\u00e9cente Pag\u00e9, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 travailler au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019AE m\u00eame si elle suivait une formation \u00e0 temps plein.Note de bas de page 5\n[32] Cependant, il ressort de la preuve que contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Pag\u00e9, la prestataire \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler seulement les week-ends et quelques heures par semaine pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Elle consacrait 42 heures par semaine \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes.Note de bas de page 6\n[33] La prestataire a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avoir trouv\u00e9 un emploi chez X qui lui offrait peu d\u2019heures de travail mais qui lui permettait d\u2019avoir un peu d\u2019argent de poche pendant ses \u00e9tudes.Note de bas de page 7\n[34] Le t\u00e9moignage de la prestataire devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est conforme \u00e0 ses nombreuses d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures o\u00f9 elle mentionne ne chercher qu\u2019un travail \u00e0 temps partiel ou occasionnel afin de se consacrer \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes.Note de bas de page 8\n[35] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance et qu\u2019elle a err\u00e9 en droit. Elle ne pouvait pas conclure que la prestataire \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler au sens de la loi compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance.\n[36] Je suis donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir.\nRem\u00e8de [37] Consid\u00e9rant que les parties ont eu l'opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur cause devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je rendrai la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[38] Pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme disponible \u00e0 travailler, une partie prestataire doit d\u00e9montrer qu'elle est capable et disponible \u00e0 travailler et incapable d'obtenir un emploi convenable.\n[39] La disponibilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e en analysant trois facteurs :\na) Le d\u00e9sir de retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable est offert; b) l\u2019expression de ce d\u00e9sir par des efforts pour trouver un emploi convenable; c) le non-\u00e9tablissement de conditions personnelles pouvant limiter ind\u00fbment les chances de retour sur le march\u00e9 du travail.\n[40] De plus, la disponibilit\u00e9 est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pour chaque jour ouvrable d'une p\u00e9riode de prestations pour lequel une partie prestataire peut prouver que, ce jour-l\u00e0, elle \u00e9tait capable et disponible pour travailler et incapable d'obtenir un emploi convenable.\n[41] Pour avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations, une partie prestataire doit \u00e9tablir sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour le travail et, pour ce faire, elle doit chercher activement du travail. Une partie prestataire doit \u00e9tablir sa disponibilit\u00e9 au travail pour chaque jour ouvrable d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations. Une simple d\u00e9claration de disponibilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas suffisante.Note de bas de page 9\n[42] Il ressort de la preuve que la prestataire \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler seulement les week-ends et quelques heures par semaine. Elle consacrait 42 heures par semaine \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 de multiples reprises ne chercher qu\u2019un travail \u00e0 temps partiel ou occasionnel afin de se consacrer \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes.\n[43] La prestataire a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avoir trouv\u00e9 un emploi chez X qui lui offrait peu d\u2019heures de travail mais qui lui permettait d\u2019avoir un peu d\u2019argent de poche pendant ses \u00e9tudes.\n[44] Le t\u00e9moignage de la prestataire devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est conforme \u00e0 ses nombreuses d\u00e9clarations ant\u00e9rieures o\u00f9 elle mentionne ne chercher qu\u2019un travail \u00e0 temps partiel ou occasionnel afin de se consacrer \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes.\n[45] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu plusieurs arr\u00eats suivants lesquels des \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 temps plein n\u2019\u00e9taient pas admissibles aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, lorsqu\u2019ils avaient restreint le genre d\u2019emploi qu\u2019ils cherchaient ou limit\u00e9 les heures o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler aux week-ends ou \u00e0 quelques heures par semaine.Note de bas de page 10\n[46] La preuve d\u00e9montre que la prestataire ne cherchait pas activement un emploi et que sa disponibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait ind\u00fbment limit\u00e9e par ses \u00e9tudes.\n[47] Pour ces raisons, je suis d\u2019avis que la prestataire n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler pendant ses \u00e9tudes conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE.\nConclusion [48] L\u2019appel de la Commission est accueilli sur la question de disponibilit\u00e9.

Cependant, la permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira donc pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La demanderesse (la prestataire) a quitt\u00e9 son emploi et a demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. La d\u00e9fenderesse (la Commission) a examin\u00e9 les raisons de la prestataire pour avoir quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la prestataire avait quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle avait choisi de quitter son emploi) sans justification. Elle ne pouvait donc pas lui verser de prestations.\n[3] La Commission a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019au lieu de partir quand elle l\u2019a fait, la prestataire aurait pu essayer de r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019elle avait avec une de ses coll\u00e8gues. Elle aurait pu parler \u00e0 son employeur des probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019elle avait avec sa coll\u00e8gue pour voir s\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres solutions. Apr\u00e8s une r\u00e9vision d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, la prestataire a fait appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire avait quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi. Elle a jug\u00e9 que d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables s\u2019offraient \u00e0 elle lorsqu\u2019elle a quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\n[5] La prestataire demande la permission de faire appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel. Bien que la prestataire en ait fait la demande, elle n\u2019a pas fourni ses moyens d\u2019appel dans le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si la prestataire a soulev\u00e9 une erreur r\u00e9visable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commise et qui pourrait donner \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance de succ\u00e8s.\n[7] J\u2019accorde une prolongation du d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser la demande de permission de faire appel. Cependant, je refuse la permission de faire appel parce que l\u2019appel de la prestataire n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestions pr\u00e9liminaires [8] Pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente demande, je dois examiner la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 1.\nQuestions en litige [9] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en retard? b) Si j\u2019\u00e9tablis qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en retard, devrais-je prolonger le d\u00e9lai de pr\u00e9sentation de la demande? c) La prestataire soul\u00e8ve-t-elle une erreur r\u00e9visable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commise et qui pourrait donner \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse La demande \u00e9tait en retard [10] La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le 5 octobre 2023. La d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e par courriel \u00e0 la prestataire le 22 ao\u00fbt 2023. La demande est donc en retard.\nJe prolonge le d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande [11] Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder une prolongation du d\u00e9lai, je dois v\u00e9rifier si la prestataire a une explication raisonnable justifiant son retardNote de bas de page 2.\n[12] La prestataire soutient que son amie qui travaillait sur son appel a d\u00fb arr\u00eater en raison d\u2019engagements de travail. Je remarque que la prestataire et son amie ont t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au Tribunal pour obtenir le formulaire de demande de permission de faire appel.\n[13] Je conclus que le retard est seulement de deux semaines. La prestataire n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune explication raisonnable pour justifier son retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la prestataire la permission de faire appel [14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait \u00e9tablir si la prestataire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi. Cela doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli au moment o\u00f9 elle est partie.\n[15] La question de savoir si une personne \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi d\u00e9pend de la question de savoir si, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable qui s\u2019offrait \u00e0 elle.\n[16] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi en raison d\u2019un conflit avec une coll\u00e8gue de travail. Elle n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur ni \u00e0 la directrice de l\u2019usine de ses probl\u00e8mes avec ladite coll\u00e8gue avant de d\u00e9missionner. Elle a conclu qu\u2019une solution raisonnable aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 que la prestataire discute de son probl\u00e8me avec l\u2019employeur afin qu\u2019ils r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissent aux solutions possibles.\n[17] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que lorsqu\u2019une partie prestataire n\u2019est pas satisfaite de ses conditions de travail, elle doit discuter avec son employeur avant de partir pour lui donner l\u2019occasion de corriger la situation. L\u2019employeur a dit que s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant du probl\u00e8me, il aurait pu essayer de le r\u00e9gler Note de bas de page 3. Une partie prestataire a \u00e9galement l\u2019obligation de chercher du travail avant de quitter son emploi. La prestataire ne satisfaisait \u00e0 aucune de ces exigences pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi Note de bas de page 4.\n[18] Malheureusement pour la prestataire, un appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal n\u2019est pas une nouvelle audience o\u00f9 une partie peut pr\u00e9senter de nouveau sa preuve et esp\u00e9rer une nouvelle issue favorable \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[19] Dans sa demande de permission de faire appel, la prestataire n\u2019a relev\u00e9 aucune erreur r\u00e9visable, comme une erreur de comp\u00e9tence ou un manquement \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle de la part de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle n\u2019a cern\u00e9 aucune erreur de droit ni conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait pu tirer de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire, ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance au moment de rendre sa d\u00e9cision.\n[20] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019appel, la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et les arguments de la prestataire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande de permission de faire appel, je conclus que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [21] J\u2019accorde une prolongation du d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter une demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel. Je rejette la demande de permission de faire appel. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira donc pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Sibbald c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2022 CAF 157.\nNote de bas de page 2\nC\u2019est ce que dit l\u2019article 27(2) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la page GD3-40 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la page GD3-15 du dossier d\u2019appel.

Par cons\u00e9quent, la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 le 16 janvier 2022 et non le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022.\n[3] On ne peut pas affirmer que l\u2019appelant a effectu\u00e9 des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022. Son niveau d\u2019engagement dans son entreprise au cours de ces semaines \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 (la d\u00e9finition de cette expression se trouve ci-dessous). On ne peut donc pas lui refuser des prestations parentales de l\u2019assurance-emploi au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en ch\u00f4mage pendant ces semaines.\nAper\u00e7u [4] L\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 son emploi en ao\u00fbt 2021 pour lancer sa propre entreprise de sous-traitance. Au moment de son d\u00e9part, il avait accumul\u00e9 2173 heures d\u2019emploi assurable dans le cadre de cet emploi.\n[5] Le 10 janvier 2022, l\u2019\u00e9pouse de l\u2019appelant a accouch\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment. Elle a d\u00fb subir une intervention chirurgicale et a pass\u00e9 du temps aux soins intensifs. Elle ne pouvait pas s\u2019occuper du b\u00e9b\u00e9 ni de leur enfant a\u00een\u00e9.\n[6] L\u2019appelant a d\u00fb cesser de travailler dans son entreprise du 10 janvier au 5 mars 2022 pour s\u2019occuper de sa famille pendant que son \u00e9pouse se r\u00e9tablissait. Il a demand\u00e9 des prestations parentales.\n[7] La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelant. En effet, l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 des prestations pour les travailleurs autonomes et ne remplissait pas les conditions pour y \u00eatre admissible.\n[8] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me demande de prestations parentales \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9, en fonction des heures assurables qu\u2019il avait accumul\u00e9es dans le cadre de son emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n[9] La Commission a \u00e9galement rejet\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me demande. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en ch\u00f4mage parce qu\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 son compte et que l\u2019on doit donc pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019il effectuait des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail.\n[10] L\u2019appelant affirme ne pas avoir travaill\u00e9 du 10 janvier au 5 mars 2022. Il ne pouvait pas travailler pendant qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait de son nouveau-n\u00e9, de son enfant a\u00een\u00e9 et de sa femme. Il affirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pendant cette p\u00e9riode et qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre admissible aux prestations parentales.\nQuestion que je dois examiner en premier La division d\u2019appel a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [11] Le pr\u00e9sent appel a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 instruit par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel.\n[12] L\u2019appelant a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal. La division d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[13] La division d\u2019appel a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle renvoyait l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce que la membre qui avait initialement instruit l\u2019appel n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 la bonne p\u00e9riode lorsqu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant effectuait des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail. La membre a examin\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode du 10 janvier au 5 mars 2022. La division d\u2019appel affirme qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb analyser la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022. Elle a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour permettre \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant son niveau d\u2019engagement dans son entreprise pour la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022.\n[14] Avant l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur des questions qui devaient \u00eatre clarifi\u00e9es pour que je puisse me pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019appel.Note de bas de page 1\n[15] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires que j\u2019ai re\u00e7us avant l\u2019audience,Note de bas de page 2 et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du t\u00e9moignage qui m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que je devrais seulement examiner si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage apr\u00e8s le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022. Je suis d\u2019avis que pour trancher l\u2019appel, je dois d\u2019abord d\u00e9cider quand la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9. Ensuite, je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pendant l\u2019une des semaines de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[16] Je ne suis pas tenue de suivre les directives qui se trouvent dans la d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appelNote de bas de page 3; j\u2019ai le droit d\u2019examiner plus que ce que la division d\u2019appel m\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019examiner.Note de bas de page 4 Je vais donc examiner les deux questions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessous, plut\u00f4t que de me limiter \u00e0 examiner si l\u2019appelant avait des semaines de ch\u00f4mage apr\u00e8s le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022, comme la division d\u2019appel l\u2019a ordonn\u00e9.\nQuestions en litige [17] \u00c0 quelle date la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a-t-elle commenc\u00e9?\n[18] L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il en ch\u00f4mage pendant l\u2019une des semaines de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations?\nAnalyse \u00c0 quelle date la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a-t-elle commenc\u00e9? [19] Je conclus que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 le 16 janvier 2022, et non le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022, comme l\u2019a \u00e9tabli la Commission.\n[20] La loi pr\u00e9voit que la p\u00e9riode de prestations commence, selon le cas :\nle dimanche de la semaine au cours de laquelle l\u2019appelant a subi un arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (sept jours cons\u00e9cutifs sans travail et sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration); le dimanche de la semaine au cours de laquelle la demande initiale de prestations est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9eNote de bas de page 5.\n[21] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations le 19 janvier 2022. Au moment de sa demande, il n\u2019avait pas travaill\u00e9 et n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucun revenu depuis le 4 janvier 2022.Note de bas de page 6 C\u2019est \u00e0 cette date-l\u00e0 que son \u00e9pouse a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\n[22] Cependant, l\u2019appelant a commis une erreur en pr\u00e9sentant sa demande. Il a indiqu\u00e9 dans le formulaire de demande qu\u2019il demandait des prestations pour les travailleurs autonomes. Il l\u2019a fait parce qu\u2019il exploitait sa propre entreprise \u00e0 compter du 21 ao\u00fbt 2021. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur.\n[23] Les travailleurs autonomes ne sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas admissibles aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 moins de conclure une entente avec la Commission pour recevoir des prestations sp\u00e9ciales et payer les cotisations requises. Toutefois, une partie prestataire peut \u00eatre admissible aux prestations si elle a accumul\u00e9 le nombre requis d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable et si elle peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pendant chaque semaine que les prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es.Note de bas de page 7\n[24] L\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas conclu d\u2019entente avec la Commission pour recevoir des prestations sp\u00e9ciales. Cependant, il avait accumul\u00e9 assez d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable au cours de sa p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour \u00eatre admissible aux prestations des employ\u00e9s.Note de bas de page 8 Ainsi, lorsqu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations le 19 janvier 2022, il aurait d\u00fb cocher la case pour demander des prestations pour les employ\u00e9s, plut\u00f4t que la case pour demander des prestations pour les travailleurs autonomes.\n[25] Comme il a coch\u00e9 la mauvaise case, la Commission a rejet\u00e9 sa demande.Note de bas de page 9 Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission aurait d\u00fb traiter la demande de l\u2019appelant comme s\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 des prestations pour employ\u00e9s plut\u00f4t que des prestations pour travailleurs autonomes.\n[26] Selon la jurisprudence, une partie prestataire ne devrait pas se voir refuser ses droits parce qu\u2019elle a coch\u00e9 la mauvaise case dans un formulaire de demande.Note de bas de page 10 D\u2019apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence, si une partie prestataire a choisi le mauvais type de prestations, elle devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir demand\u00e9 le type de prestations auquel elle avait droit.\n[27] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas trait\u00e9 la demande de prestations de l\u2019appelant pour travailleurs autonomes comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s. En effet, c\u2019est ce que la jurisprudence exige.\n[28] La Commission dit qu\u2019elle a envisag\u00e9 de le faire. Elle a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 de [traduction] \u00ab multiples \u00bb reprises de communiquer avec lui afin d\u2019obtenir plus de renseignements.Note de bas de page 11 Elle soutient qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9tablie si une partie prestataire ne fournit pas les renseignements sous la forme et de la mani\u00e8re fix\u00e9es par la Commission.Note de bas de page 12 Elle n\u2019a donc pas \u00e9tabli de p\u00e9riode de prestations relativement \u00e0 la demande de prestations du 19 janvier 2022.\n[29] Je n\u2019accepte pas l\u2019explication de la Commission.\n[30] Premi\u00e8rement, la Commission indique que le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2022, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant devait pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s.Note de bas de page 13 Toutefois, rien ne prouve qu\u2019elle a rendu une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision au sujet de la demande de prestations lorsqu\u2019elle a rendu cette d\u00e9cision.Note de bas de page 14 Elle a plut\u00f4t dit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas r\u00e9viser sa demande.Note de bas de page 15 D\u2019ailleurs, la Commission se contredit. Sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle elle aurait rendu une telle d\u00e9cision est invalid\u00e9e par le fait qu\u2019elle a tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec l\u2019appelant pour obtenir plus de renseignements afin de d\u00e9cider si sa demande pouvait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme une demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s. Elle a tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec l\u2019appelant le 22, le 23 et le 24 f\u00e9vrier, soit apr\u00e8s le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2022, date \u00e0 laquelle elle aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant devait pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande.\n[31] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la preuve d\u00e9montre que le 4 mars 2022, l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s.Note de bas de page 16 C\u2019est la Commission qui lui a dit de le faire.Note de bas de page 17\n[32] Gr\u00e2ce aux informations qui se trouvent dans cette demande et dans la premi\u00e8re demande du 19 janvier 2022, la situation d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelant et les circonstances relatives \u00e0 son arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration sont claires, comme l\u2019exige la loi.Note de bas de page 18\n[33] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa deuxi\u00e8me demande, et la Commission n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de communiquer de nouveau avec lui pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements. Ainsi, je conclus que l\u2019appelant a fourni tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires sous la forme et de la mani\u00e8re fix\u00e9es par la Commission et que celle-ci \u00e9tait convaincue qu\u2019elle avait tout ce qu\u2019il lui fallait pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la demande.Note de bas de page 19\n[34] Le 20 mai 2022, la Commission a bel et bien rendu une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la demande de l\u2019appelant. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en ch\u00f4mage. Elle a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que la date du d\u00e9but de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations \u00e9tait le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022.Note de bas de page 20\n[35] Je conclus que la Commission a commis une erreur lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9tabli que la p\u00e9riode de prestations commen\u00e7ait le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022. Je suis d\u2019avis que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9tablie comme ayant commenc\u00e9 le 16 janvier 2022.Note de bas de page 21\n[36] En effet, l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande initiale le 19 janvier 2022. Cette demande n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.Note de bas de page 22 De plus, l\u2019appelant a fourni tous les renseignements qu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 de fournir, lesquels permettaient \u00e0 la Commission de traiter sa demande initiale (du 19 janvier 2022) comme une demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s, comme la jurisprudence l\u2019y oblige.\n[37] Bien que l\u2019appelant n\u2019ait peut-\u00eatre pas r\u00e9pondu au message vocal laiss\u00e9 par la Commission le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2022, il lui a fourni des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires sur sa demande le 4 mars 2022, en d\u00e9posant une nouvelle demande comme on lui avait demand\u00e9 de le faire. La Commission n\u2019a rien demand\u00e9 d\u2019autre avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant aux prestations parentales \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9. Ainsi, contrairement \u00e0 ce que soutient la Commission, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de ses obligations l\u00e9gales puisqu\u2019il a fourni les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[38] Pour toutes ces raisons, la date de d\u00e9but des prestations de l\u2019appelant devrait \u00eatre le 16 janvier 2022 plut\u00f4t que le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022.\n[39] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que la Commission \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de traiter la demande du 19 janvier 2022 comme une demande de prestations pour employ\u00e9s, la question de l\u2019antidatation ne se pose pas dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Toutefois, si une antidatation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 requise pour que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant commence plus t\u00f4t, j\u2019aurais conclu que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019examiner cette question et que l\u2019appelant avait un motif valable justifiant son retard.\n[40] La division d\u2019appel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Tribunal devrait adopter une approche g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa comp\u00e9tence pour g\u00e9rer les appels de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et efficace.Note de bas de page 23 Elle affirme que le Tribunal devrait examiner les demandes et les d\u00e9cisions sous-jacentes pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision. Je suis d\u2019accord avec le point de vue de la division d\u2019appel.\n[41] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il y a eu un certain nombre de demandes de r\u00e9vision et un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions. Lorsqu\u2019on examine toute la chronologie, je crois qu\u2019il est clair que la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision rendue par la Commission le 12 ao\u00fbt 2022 a implicitement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la demande de prestations du 4 mars 2022 de l\u2019appelant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre antidat\u00e9e au 10 janvier 2022.\n[42] Je tire cette conclusion en me fondant sur les demandes de r\u00e9vision et les d\u00e9cisions suivantes :\nUne d\u00e9cision informant l\u2019appelant que la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pour travailleurs ind\u00e9pendants.Note de bas de page 24 Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie d\u2019une demande de r\u00e9vision qui demande \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019examiner si l\u2019appelant serait admissible aux prestations parentales \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait accumul\u00e9 un nombre suffisant d\u2019heures assurables dans le cadre de son emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.Note de bas de page 25 La Commission a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision au motif qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas encore tranch\u00e9 la question de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant aux prestations parentales (vraisemblablement \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations pour travailleurs ind\u00e9pendants).Note de bas de page 26 Une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 20 mai 2022 informant l\u2019appelant que la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser des prestations \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 compter du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022, parce qu\u2019il travaillait \u00e0 son propre compte et donc n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en ch\u00f4mage.Note de bas de page 27 Le 15 juin 2022, l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser cette d\u00e9cision pour la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9j\u00e0 retir\u00e9e.Note de bas de page 28 Une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 12 ao\u00fbt 2022 informant l\u2019appelant que la Commission maintenait sa d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure.Note de bas de page 29 Une lettre de d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 25 ao\u00fbt 2022 informant l\u2019appelant que ses prestations ne peuvent pas commencer le 21 ao\u00fbt 2021.Note de bas de page 30\n[43] Il ressort clairement de la preuve que l\u2019appelant a toujours eu l\u2019intention de demander des prestations \u00e0 compter du 10 janvier 2022. La Commission l\u2019a admis dans ses observations orales devant la division d\u2019appel.Note de bas de page 31\n[44] Il est \u00e9galement clair que lorsque l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de r\u00e9vision du 15 juin 2022, il demandait \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser son admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations parentales \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 entre le 10 janvier et le 5 mars 2022. C\u2019est la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9j\u00e0 retir\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans sa demande.\n[45] En d\u00e9cidant de maintenir sa d\u00e9cision selon laquelle l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations \u00e0 compter du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022, la Commission a implicitement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant ne pouvait pas commencer \u00e0 la date ant\u00e9rieure demand\u00e9e (autrement dit, elle ne pouvait pas \u00eatre antidat\u00e9e au 10 janvier 2022, comme il l\u2019a demand\u00e9).\n[46] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que si j\u2019avais eu \u00e0 trancher la question de l\u2019antidatation pour conclure que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 avant le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2022, j\u2019aurais eu la comp\u00e9tence de le faire.\n[47] De plus, si j\u2019avais eu \u00e0 examiner la question de l\u2019antidatation, j\u2019aurais conclu que l\u2019appelant avait un motif valable justifiant son retard du 10 janvier au 4 mars 2022.\n[48] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande 9 jours apr\u00e8s la naissance de son enfant. Apr\u00e8s avoir appris que sa demande de prestations parentales pour travailleurs ind\u00e9pendants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, il a imm\u00e9diatement communiqu\u00e9 avec la Commission pour savoir ce qu\u2019il devait faire.Note de bas de page 32 Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision le 25 janvier 2022, comme on lui avait demand\u00e9 de le faire. Apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre fait dire, le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2022, que la Commission refusait de r\u00e9viser sa demande, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle demande de prestations le 4 mars 2022, comme la Commission lui avait demand\u00e9 de le faire. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il a appris que cette demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision et d\u2019\u00e9tablir la demande \u00e0 compter du 10 janvier 2022.\n[49] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant a agi avec diligence pour faire \u00e9tablir sa p\u00e9riode de prestations \u00e0 compter du 10 janvier 2022. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec la Commission pour dire qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas agi comme une personne raisonnable l\u2019aurait fait dans des circonstances similaires. Au contraire, chaque fois qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue au sujet de sa demande, il a fait un suivi en d\u00e9posant rapidement une demande de r\u00e9vision ou en d\u00e9posant une nouvelle demande, comme la Commission lui avait ordonn\u00e9 de le faire.Note de bas de page 33 Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il a agi de fa\u00e7on tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable et qu\u2019il a suivi les directives de la Commission.\n[50] De plus, du 10 janvier au 5 mars 2022, l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 aux prises avec des circonstances personnelles tr\u00e8s difficiles. Sa femme a d\u00fb subir une hyst\u00e9rectomie, elle \u00e9tait aux soins intensifs et elle se fiait aux soins de son \u00e9poux. Comme son \u00e9pouse n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de s\u2019occuper de leurs enfants, il a d\u00fb assumer ce r\u00f4le. Ces circonstances sont exceptionnelles et justifient, en soi, le retard.\n[51] Quant au fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de demande de r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision du 25 ao\u00fbt 2022 sur l\u2019antidatation, c\u2019est sans int\u00e9r\u00eat. L\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucune raison de demander la r\u00e9vision de cette d\u00e9cision. On avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 rejet\u00e9 le 12 ao\u00fbt 2022 sa demande de r\u00e9vision concernant la demande de prestations parentales commen\u00e7ant le 10 janvier 2022. De plus, la d\u00e9cision du 25 ao\u00fbt 2022 portait sur une antidatation au 21 ao\u00fbt 2021. L\u2019appelant ne souhaitait pas antidater sa demande \u00e0 cette date.Note de bas de page 34\n[52] Pour toutes ces raisons, j\u2019aurais d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait droit \u00e0 ce que sa demande de prestations du 4 mars soit trait\u00e9e comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 10 janvier 2022.\nL\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il en ch\u00f4mage pendant l\u2019une des semaines de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations? [53] Je conclus que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage chaque semaine du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022. Je juge que son niveau d\u2019engagement dans son entreprise pendant ces semaines \u00e9tait limit\u00e9.\n[54] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelant a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage \u00e0 aucun moment pendant sa p\u00e9riode de prestations apr\u00e8s le 5 mars 2022. Elle affirme qu\u2019il demande seulement des prestations pour les semaines du 10 janvier au 5 mars 2022.\n[55] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette confirmation, et apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 le 16 janvier 2022, je vais seulement examiner s\u2019il \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pendant l\u2019une des semaines du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022.\n[56] Selon la loi, une partie prestataire ne peut toucher des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi que pendant les semaines o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait sans emploiNote de bas de page 35.\n[57] Une personne est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en ch\u00f4mage si elle n\u2019effectue pas une semaine enti\u00e8re de travail.Note de bas de page 36 Toutefois, une personne qui travaille \u00e0 son compte est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire consid\u00e9r\u00e9e) avoir travaill\u00e9 une semaine enti\u00e8re \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle puisse prouver que le travail ind\u00e9pendant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas son principal moyen de subsistance pendant cette semaine (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la principale fa\u00e7on dont elle subvient \u00e0 ses besoins).Note de bas de page 37 Si elle peut le prouver, son travail ind\u00e9pendant est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant d\u2019une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e pour cette semaine et elle peut \u00eatre admissible aux prestations.\n[58] Pour d\u00e9cider si le travail ind\u00e9pendant d\u2019une partie prestataire est d\u2019une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e, la loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019il faut analyser les facteurs suivantsNote de bas de page 38 :\n1) le temps consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 un travail autonome; 2) la nature et le montant du capital et des ressources investis dans le travail autonome; 3) le succ\u00e8s ou l\u2019\u00e9chec financier de l\u2019entreprise d\u2019une partie prestataire; 4) le maintien de l\u2019entreprise; 5) la nature de l\u2019entreprise; 6) l\u2019intention et la volont\u00e9 de la partie prestataire de chercher et d\u2019accepter sans tarder un emploi assurable.\n[59] Selon la jurisprudence, au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer ces facteurs, je dois accorder la plus grande importance au temps que l\u2019appelant a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 son travail autonome et \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de trouver un emploi assurable.Note de bas de page 39 Cependant, la Commission conc\u00e8de qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant demande des prestations parentales, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019accorder de poids \u00e0 son intention de trouver un emploi assurable.Note de bas de page 40 Elle reconna\u00eet qu\u2019on ne devrait pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une personne qui demande des prestations parentales cherche du travail. Je suis d\u2019accord. Je ne tiendrai donc pas compte de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\n[60] Il incombe \u00e0 la partie prestataire de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle elle effectue des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail pendant qu\u2019elle travaille \u00e0 son compte. Pour ce faire, elle doit d\u00e9montrer, en se fondant sur les facteurs susmentionn\u00e9s, que son travail autonome est d\u2019une port\u00e9e limit\u00e9e.Note de bas de page 41 Il faut \u00e9tablir cela concr\u00e8tement au cas par cas.\n[61] Je vais donc devoir examiner chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9mentsNote de bas de page 42 afin de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en ch\u00f4mage pendant une des semaines entre le 16 janvier 2022 (date du d\u00e9but de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations) et le 5 mars 2022 (selon sa repr\u00e9sentante, c\u2019est la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e o\u00f9 il n\u2019effectuait pas des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail).\nTemps consacr\u00e9 [62] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ses observations \u00e9crites et le t\u00e9moignage de sa repr\u00e9sentante \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 du tout comme entrepreneur du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022. Il n\u2019a pas visit\u00e9 de chantiers pendant cette p\u00e9riode. De plus, il n\u2019a consacr\u00e9 presque aucun temps \u00e0 l\u2019administration de son entreprise, \u00e0 part retourner quelques courriels et appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques et faire quelques petits achats.Note de bas de page 43\n[63] La repr\u00e9sentante de l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a consacr\u00e9 absolument aucun temps \u00e0 son entreprise au cours des semaines du 16 janvier et du 23 janvier 2022 et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consacr\u00e9 plus d\u2019une heure par semaine du 30 janvier au 5 mars 2022.Note de bas de page 44 Avant le 10 janvier 2022, elle dit qu\u2019il y consacrait au moins 40 heures par semaine.\n[64] Je crois l\u2019appelant et sa repr\u00e9sentante. Ils disent que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a consacr\u00e9 presque aucun temps \u00e0 son entreprise du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022. Son \u00e9pouse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 aux soins intensifs. Elle \u00e9tait incapable de s\u2019occuper de leur nouveau-n\u00e9 et de leur enfant a\u00een\u00e9 pendant qu\u2019elle se r\u00e9tablissait. Ainsi, pendant ces semaines, l\u2019appelant devait s\u2019occuper tout seul de sa famille. C\u2019\u00e9tait la routine jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que son \u00e9pouse retrouve la sant\u00e9 et se remette \u00e0 l\u2019aider \u00e0 s\u2019occuper des enfants \u00e0 compter du 6 mars 2022.\nInvestissements [65] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa demande de prestations qu\u2019il avait investi entre 10 000 $ et 15 000 $, cet argent \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019achat et \u00e0 la location de mat\u00e9riaux. Cependant, sa repr\u00e9sentante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fait cet investissement au moment de lancer son entreprise. Il n\u2019a fait aucun autre investissement entre le 16 janvier et le 5 mars 2022, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 parental.\nR\u00e9ussite financi\u00e8re [66] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa demande de prestations que son revenu annuel provenant de son entreprise \u00e9tait sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 20 000 $.\n[67] Toutefois, il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucun revenu d\u2019entreprise entre le 16 janvier et le 5 mars 2022.\n[68] L\u2019absence de revenus au cours de cette p\u00e9riode n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement une question de calendrier des paiements de la client\u00e8le, ou une p\u00e9riode plus lente dans le cycle \u00e9conomique. Il ressort clairement de la preuve que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucun revenu pendant cette p\u00e9riode parce qu\u2019il ne pouvait accepter aucun emploi. Il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler dans son entreprise parce qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait de sa famille.\n[69] Ainsi, m\u00eame si l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait prosp\u00e8re sur une base annuelle, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait certainement pas prosp\u00e8re du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022.\nLe maintien de l\u2019entreprise [70] L\u2019appelant ne conteste pas qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de continuer d\u2019exploiter son entreprise d\u00e8s que son \u00e9pouse recommencerait \u00e0 prendre soin de leurs enfants et qu\u2019il pourrait mettre fin \u00e0 son cong\u00e9 parental. Sa repr\u00e9sentante a confirm\u00e9 que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019il a fait \u00e0 partir du 6 mars 2022, d\u00e8s que son \u00e9pouse se portait assez bien.\nNature du travail autonome [71] La jurisprudence laisse entendre que si l\u2019emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la partie prestataire est similaire \u00e0 l\u2019activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce maintenant \u00e0 son propre compte (dans son entreprise), cela peut indiquer que l\u2019emploi ne servait que de tremplin pour son travail autonome.Note de bas de page 45\n[72] Ce principe ne s\u2019applique pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019appelant ne travaillait pas en m\u00eame temps comme employ\u00e9 et \u00e0 son propre compte. Il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi pour lancer son entreprise.\n[73] De plus, l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelant ne rel\u00e8ve pas du domaine de son emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nQue peut-on donc tirer de ces facteurs? [74] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son niveau d\u2019engagement dans son entreprise \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 au cours des semaines du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022.\n[75] Il n\u2019a consacr\u00e9 pratiquement aucun temps \u00e0 l\u2019entreprise, n\u2019a tir\u00e9 aucun revenu de l\u2019entreprise et n\u2019a pas investi dans l\u2019entreprise pendant ces semaines.\n[76] Je suis d\u2019avis que cela suffit pour conclure qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pendant ces semaines, d\u2019autant plus que la jurisprudence indique que le temps consacr\u00e9 est le facteur qui a le plus d\u2019importance dans ce cas-ci.\n[77] Il convient de signaler que la loi reconna\u00eet qu\u2019une partie prestataire qui travaille \u00e0 son compte et qui est en cong\u00e9 parental n\u2019a pas \u00e0 cl\u00f4turer compl\u00e8tement les activit\u00e9s de son entreprise pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant en ch\u00f4mage donc admissible aux prestations.Note de bas de page 46\n[78] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que m\u00eame si l\u2019entreprise de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue et qu\u2019il y est retourn\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 parental, ces facteurs n\u2019ont aucune incidence dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[79] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve, je suis convaincue que l\u2019appelant a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle il effectuait des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022.Note de bas de page 47\nConclusion [80] La p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 le 16 janvier 2022.\n[81] Du 16 janvier au 5 mars 2022, l\u2019appelant n\u2019effectuait pas des semaines enti\u00e8res de travail. Il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son niveau d\u2019engagement dans son entreprise au cours de cette p\u00e9riode \u00e9tait limit\u00e9. Cela signifie qu\u2019il doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en ch\u00f4mage pendant ces semaines.\n[82] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir RGD2.\nNote de bas de page 2\nPlus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment : RGD5.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir le paragraphe 82 de la d\u00e9cision Wilson c \u00c9nergie atomique du Canada limit\u00e9e, 2016 CSC 29 : la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada y affirme que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs ne sont pas li\u00e9s par le principe du stare decision relativement aux d\u00e9cisions de leur propre tribunal (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 suivre les autres d\u00e9cisions de leur tribunal).

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi en date du 6 avril 2020. Une p\u00e9riode de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence (PUAE) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Le 13 avril 2020, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) a vers\u00e9 une avance de 2000 $ au prestataire.\n[3] Le 13 novembre 2021, la Commission r\u00e9clame du prestataire l\u2019avance re\u00e7ue de 2000 $. Selon la Commission, le prestataire a re\u00e7u neuf semaines de PUAE, alors qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en p\u00e9riode de ch\u00f4mage pendant cinq semaines. Il doit donc rembourser les prestations vers\u00e9es en trop, soit l\u2019avance au montant de 2000 $.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u cinq semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence au taux de 500 $ pour un total de de 2500 $ pour la p\u00e9riode du 22 mars 2020 au 25 avril 2020. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u la somme totale de 4500 $. Il a donc re\u00e7u 2000 $ en trop. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire doit rembourser \u00e0 la Commission la somme de 2000 $.\n[5] Le prestataire demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il fait valoir que si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019annuler la dette, elle n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de lui demander de rembourser le trop-pay\u00e9.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[7] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [8] Est-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ?\nAnalyse [9] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[11] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ? [12] Le prestataire fait valoir que si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019annuler la dette, elle n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de lui demander de rembourser le trop-pay\u00e9.\n[13] Le prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision de la Commission concernant le versement anticip\u00e9 de la PUAE au montant de 2000 $.\n[14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u cinq semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence au taux de 500 $ pour un total de de 2500 $ pour la p\u00e9riode du 22 mars 2020 au 25 avril 2020. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u la somme totale de 4500 $. Il a donc re\u00e7u 2000 $ en trop. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire doit rembourser \u00e0 la Commission la somme de 2000 $.\n[15] Je constate que la loi mise en vigueur pendant la pand\u00e9mie permet \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser si une personne a re\u00e7u une somme \u00e0 titre de PUAE pour laquelle elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible. La loi indique clairement que la personne doit rembourser la PUAE vers\u00e9e en trop.Note de bas de page 1\n[16] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a donc commis aucune erreur r\u00e9visable en concluant que la loi oblige le prestataire \u00e0 rembourser le trop-pay\u00e9 de PUAE.\n[17] La loi ne donne aucune discr\u00e9tion au Tribunal afin d\u2019annuler le montant du remboursement \u00e0 payer.\n[18] La loi accorde \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019annuler une dette qui lui est d\u00fb en vertu de la loi.Note de bas de page 2\n[19] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments du prestataire au soutien de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\nConclusion [20] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir les articles 44, 52 et 153.6 (1) (a) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance -emploi.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir article 56 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n",

Le requ\u00e9rant a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du ministre en appel devant le Tribunal, soutenant que le ministre aurait d\u00fb approuver une pension partielle de 39\/40e.\n[3] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel du requ\u00e9rant, concluant qu\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 une pension partielle au taux de 38\/40e.\nQuestions en litige [4] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) Est-il d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait parce qu\u2019elle a ignor\u00e9 la preuve du requ\u00e9rant, qui avait demand\u00e9 le report de ses paiements de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pour prolonger \u00e0 39 ans sa p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au Canada? b) Le requ\u00e9rant pr\u00e9sente-t-il, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [5] Je peux accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 1.\n[6] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il pr\u00e9sente dans sa demande des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 2.\n[7] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019argument d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019il y ait eu une erreur parce que la preuve du requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e [8] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait parce qu\u2019elle a ignor\u00e9 sa preuveNote de bas de page 3. Le requ\u00e9rant explique avoir imm\u00e9diatement r\u00e9pondu au ministre apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u sa lettre du 25 mai 2021, qui l\u2019informait qu\u2019il recevrait une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse au taux de 38\/40e. Il a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9vision parce qu\u2019il voulait que le paiement de sa pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse soit retard\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il termine sa 39e ann\u00e9e de r\u00e9sidence au Canada, pour que sa pension partielle atteigne 39\/40eNote de bas de page 4.

Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a pris acte de l\u2019argument du requ\u00e9rant voulant que sa pension n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb commencer avant qu\u2019il atteigne 39 ans de r\u00e9sidenceNote de bas de page 5.\n[10] Toutefois, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 que le ministre calcule le montant de la pension partielle en fonction du nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles le requ\u00e9rant r\u00e9side au Canada apr\u00e8s avoir eu 18 ans et avant le jour o\u00f9 le ministre approuve sa demandeNote de bas de page 6. Le ministre a approuv\u00e9 la demande en fonction d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence qui a pris fin le 1er juillet 2021.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris que le requ\u00e9rant voulait que le versement de sa pension soit report\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il atteigne 39 ans de r\u00e9sidence. Lorsque le requ\u00e9rant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait que la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse lui soit vers\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu\u2019il y \u00e9tait admissibleNote de bas de page 7. Le ministre avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 approuv\u00e9 sa demande quand le requ\u00e9rant lui a demand\u00e9 de retarder le versement de sa pension. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable en affirmant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la demande qu\u2019il avait faite au ministre alors que sa pension avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9\u00e9e.\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 la loi relative aux p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9sidence pour la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, puis elle l\u2019a appliqu\u00e9e au cas du requ\u00e9rant. La requ\u00eate qu'il a faite apr\u00e8s l\u2019approbation de sa demande n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat. Le requ\u00e9rant ne peut pas d\u00e9fendre que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur en appliquant la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9voit la Loi sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\n[13] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 la preuve concernant la demande de r\u00e9vision du requ\u00e9rant. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 le droit aux faits de la demande du requ\u00e9rant. Une fois que le ministre approuve une demande de pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, le montant de la pension ne peut \u00eatre major\u00e9 sur la base d\u2019ann\u00e9es additionnelles de r\u00e9sidence au CanadaNote de bas de page 8.\nAucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment depuis la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [14] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ainsi, la permission d\u2019en appeler ne peut pas lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour ce motif non plus.\n[15] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le d\u00e9fendeur (prestataire) a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper un emploi comme employ\u00e9 d\u2019entretien le 6 septembre 2023 en raison d\u2019un manque de travail. Il a re\u00e7u des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi jusqu\u2019au 24 d\u00e9cembre 2023. Apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification de la demanderesse (Commission), celle-ci a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire avait travaill\u00e9 pour une autre compagnie d\u2019entretien le 26 septembre, mais qu\u2019il avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, insatisfait de ses conditions de travail.\n[3] La Commission a examin\u00e9 les raisons du d\u00e9part et statu\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 au sens de la loi de quitter volontairement son emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations. Le prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9coulant de la r\u00e9vision aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi apr\u00e8s seulement une journ\u00e9e. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 de quitter son emploi au sens de la loi.\n[5] La Commission demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit.\n[6] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par la Commission ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [7] Est-ce que la Commission soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [8] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[9] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que la Commission doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel elle devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, la Commission n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais elle doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, elle doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[10] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par la Commission conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que la Commission soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s? [11] La Commission fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a omis de consid\u00e9rer si le fait pour le prestataire de quitter volontairement son emploi par suite de modifications importantes \u00e0 ses fonctions, constituait la seule solution raisonnable. Elle fait valoir que cette omission constitue une erreur de droit.\n[12] La question en instance devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si le prestataire a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi sans justification.Note de bas de page 1 Ceci doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 selon les circonstances qui pr\u00e9valent au moment du d\u00e9part.\n[13] La preuve non contest\u00e9e d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a accord\u00e9 foi au t\u00e9moignage du prestataire. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019entente verbale avec la nouvelle direction \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il conserverait les m\u00eames t\u00e2ches que celles effectu\u00e9es pendant les 10 mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents soient l\u2019entretien g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du magasin de grande surface, nettoyage de plancher, vadrouille, etc. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019entente initiale, \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d\u2019essai, on lui a demand\u00e9 de laver la vaisselle, d\u2019aider \u00e0 la cuisine, pr\u00e9textant que c\u2019\u00e9taient des t\u00e2ches connexes. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une modification importante de ses fonctions.Note de bas de page 2\n[14] Je constate que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 si le d\u00e9part du prestataire constituait la seule solution raisonnable.\n[15] Un prestataire ne doit pas d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune autre solution que de quitter son emploi. Son fardeau de preuve exige plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune autre solution raisonnable que de quitter en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances de son cas.\n[16] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur ne d\u00e9montrait aucune flexibilit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il insistait pour que le prestataire performe les nouvelles t\u00e2ches. Son poste \u00e9tait manifestement diff\u00e9rent que celui entendu entre les parties au pr\u00e9alable. Elle a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi.\n[17] Demeurer \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019employeur pendant la recherche d\u2019un autre emploi, tel que propos\u00e9 par la Commission, ne constituait pas une solution raisonnable alors que le prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour faire d\u2019autres t\u00e2ches que celles pr\u00e9vues au d\u00e9part entre les parties.\n[18] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9part volontaire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le prestataire, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, n\u2019avait d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi.\n[19] Un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une occasion pour la Commission de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa position et esp\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Je constate que la Commission ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit ou de fait ou de comp\u00e9tence concernant le d\u00e9part volontaire du prestataire dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [21] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nConform\u00e9ment aux articles 29 et 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 29(c) (ix) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n",

La prestataire \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec la formulation d\u2019une question dans son \u00e9valuation puisqu\u2019elle consid\u00e9rait que celle-ci contrevenait \u00e0 la Charte des droits de la personne (Charte).

[11] La prestataire fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 des raisons invoqu\u00e9es par la prestataire pour justifier son d\u00e9part. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la question comprise dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation du personnel qui, \u00e0 son avis, est contraire \u00e0 la Charte.\n[12] La question devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait de d\u00e9terminer si la prestataire avait quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi sans justification au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.Note de bas de page 1 Ceci doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 selon les circonstances qui pr\u00e9valent au moment du d\u00e9part.\n[13] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a choisi de quitter son emploi car le formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation du personnel pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la responsable des ressources humaines, contenait une question sur la diversit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle la prestataire ne souhaitait pas r\u00e9pondre. Le directeur a convoqu\u00e9 les parties afin de discuter de la situation. La prestataire a reconnu avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner de son emploi \u00e0 la suite de cette rencontre au sujet de la question pr\u00e9vue au formulaire.Note de bas de page 2\n[14] Lors de cette m\u00eame rencontre, la prestataire a reconnu n\u2019avoir aucune animosit\u00e9 envers la repr\u00e9sentante des ressources humaines au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 salariale.Note de bas de page 3\n[15] Il ressort clairement de la preuve que la prestataire a quitt\u00e9 son emploi en raison de la question du formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation qu\u2019elle jugeait inappropri\u00e9e ou inacceptable.\n[16] M\u00eame si je devais en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb se prononcer sur la Charte, et que la question mentionn\u00e9e au formulaire \u00e9tait effectivement contraire \u00e0 la Charte, la prestataire se devait d\u2019explorer d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables avant de quitter son emploi.\n[17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire avait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire aurait pu attendre la d\u00e9cision de son sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la suite de leur rencontre du 8 mars 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l'employeur cherchait une solution au probl\u00e8me. Il aurait pu dispenser la prestataire de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question contest\u00e9e.Note de bas de page 4\n[18] Le directeur a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de changer de bureau, de faire du t\u00e9l\u00e9travail et qu'il aurait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 possible pour les deux employ\u00e9es de limiter leurs contacts car elles ne faisaient pas le m\u00eame travail. La prestataire aurait pu \u00e9galement se chercher un autre emploi qui lui convenait davantage.\n[19] La situation de la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas intol\u00e9rable au point de justifier son d\u00e9part imm\u00e9diat au lieu d\u2019attendre la d\u00e9cision de son employeur. La prestataire a d\u2019ailleurs donn\u00e9 un pr\u00e9avis d\u2019une semaine \u00e0 son employeur.\n[20] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e de quitter son emploi au moment o\u00f9 elle l\u2019a fait.\n[21] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9part volontaire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si la prestataire, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, n\u2019avait d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi.\n[22] La prestataire \u00e9tait manifestement en d\u00e9saccord avec la question pr\u00e9vue au formulaire et sa relation avec la repr\u00e9sentante des ressources humaines \u00e9tait certes tendues. Cependant, il existait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables pour la prestataire que de quitter son emploi au moment o\u00f9 elle l\u2019a fait.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [24] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La demanderesse (prestataire) a demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi le 24 mars 2020. Une p\u00e9riode de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence (PUAE) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 partir du 22 mars 2020.\n[3] Le 6 avril 2020, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) lui a vers\u00e9 une avance de 2 000 $. La Commission lui a aussi vers\u00e9 sept semaines de PUAE. Au total, la prestataire a re\u00e7u 5 500 $ de PUAE. Selon la Commission, la prestataire a re\u00e7u 2 000 $ de trop de PUAE. Elle aurait d\u00fb recevoir seulement 3 500 $. La prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision de la Commission devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a re\u00e7u des prestations pour une p\u00e9riode \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 11 semaines, alors qu\u2019elle pouvait en recevoir pour une p\u00e9riode de sept semaines. Elle a conclu que la somme de 2 000 $ repr\u00e9sentait un versement exc\u00e9dentaire qui devait \u00eatre rembours\u00e9 par la prestataire.\n[5] La prestataire demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019urgence sans son consentement. Elle n\u2019avait pas besoin de s\u2019endetter de 2 000 $ puisqu\u2019elle avait une marge de cr\u00e9dit. Elle demande que le trop-pay\u00e9 soit annul\u00e9 car elle n\u2019est pas responsable de cette situation.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[7] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par la prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [8] Est-ce que la prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ?\nAnalyse [9] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que la prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel elle devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, la prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, elle doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, elle doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[11] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par la prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que la prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ? [12] La prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019urgence sans son consentement. Elle n\u2019avait pas besoin de s\u2019endetter de cette somme puisqu\u2019elle avait une marge de cr\u00e9dit. Elle demande que le trop-pay\u00e9 soit annul\u00e9 car elle n\u2019est pas responsable de cette situation.\n[13] Le 24 mars 2020, la prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. Une demande de PUAE a pris effet le 22 mars 2020.\n[14] Tel que soulign\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le gouvernement a mis en place des mesures temporaires pendant la pand\u00e9mie. Du 15 mars au 26 septembre 2020, toutes les demandes de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es comme des demandes de PUAE.Note de bas de page 1 Par cons\u00e9quent, si une personne demandait des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et que sa p\u00e9riode de prestations commen\u00e7ait pendant cette p\u00e9riode, les prestations re\u00e7ues \u00e9taient des prestations d\u2019urgence.\n[15] Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, la loi n\u2019offrait pas au prestataire la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir entre une demande de PUAE ou une demande de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[16] Comme la prestataire \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 la PUAE, elle a re\u00e7u un paiement en avance initial de 2 000 $ une fois sa demande \u00e9tablie. Ce paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire le 6 avril 2020.\n[17] La preuve d\u00e9montre que la prestataire a re\u00e7u un total de 11 semaines de prestations, alors qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb en recevoir seulement sept semaines. La Commission n\u2019a pas pu r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer 2 000 $ de l\u2019avance parce que la prestataire est retourn\u00e9e au travail vers le 10 mai 2020. La prestataire a donc re\u00e7u 2 000 $ en trop.\n[18] Je constate que la loi mise en vigueur pendant la pand\u00e9mie permet \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser si une personne a re\u00e7u une somme \u00e0 titre de PUAE pour laquelle elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible. La loi indique clairement que la personne doit rembourser la PUAE vers\u00e9e en trop.Note de bas de page 2\n[19] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a donc commis aucune erreur r\u00e9visable en concluant que la loi oblige la prestataire \u00e0 rembourser le trop-pay\u00e9 de PUAE.\n[20] La loi ne permet malheureusement aucun \u00e9cart et ne donne aucune discr\u00e9tion au Tribunal afin d\u2019annuler le montant du remboursement \u00e0 payer. Une telle demande doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e directement \u00e0 la Commission qui a seule comp\u00e9tence pour annuler un trop-pay\u00e9 qui lui est d\u00fb en vertu de la loi.Note de bas de page 3\n[21] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments de la prestataire au soutien de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. La prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\nConclusion [22] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e.

Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a choisi de mettre son \u00e9nergie dans son recours contre l\u2019assureur priv\u00e9, son travail, et ses \u00e9tudes. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019avait aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale pendant toute la p\u00e9riode puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait de retour au travail depuis 17 octobre 2022. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune circonstance exceptionnelle qui l\u2019aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa demande initiale de prestations de maladie plus t\u00f4t. Elle a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas de motif valable justifiant le retard pendant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e.\n[5] Je dois d\u00e9cider si on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[6] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par la prestataire ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [7] Est-ce que la prestataire soul\u00e8ve dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [8] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[9] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que la prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel elle devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, la prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, elle doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, elle doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[10] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par la prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que la prestataire soul\u00e8ve dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ? [11] La prestataire soutient que son employeur l\u2019a dirig\u00e9 vers un recours contre son assureur priv\u00e9 au lieu de lui fournir un relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi afin qu\u2019elle demande des prestations d\u2019assurance-maladie. Elle travaillait, \u00e9tudiait, et par-dessus tout, devait effectuer des exercices et se reposer pour fonctionner normalement. Elle a agi rapidement afin de faire valoir ses droits aupr\u00e8s d\u2019organismes gouvernementaux qui ne l\u2019ont pas inform\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer pour des prestations de maladie.\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019a jamais essay\u00e9 de contacter la Commission entre le 14 ao\u00fbt 2022, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin f\u00e9vrier 2023. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a choisi de mettre son \u00e9nergie dans son recours contre l\u2019assureur priv\u00e9, son travail, et ses \u00e9tudes. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019avait aucune restriction m\u00e9dicale pendant toute la p\u00e9riode puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait de retour au travail depuis 17 octobre 2022.\n[13] Je constate de la preuve que les communications de la prestataire aupr\u00e8s des organismes gouvernementaux visaient d\u2019abord et avant tout \u00e0 se renseigner sur un recours potentiel contre l\u2019assureur.\n[14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune circonstance exceptionnelle qui l\u2019aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa demande initiale de prestations de maladie plus t\u00f4t. Elle a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas de motif valable justifiant le retard pendant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e.\n[15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que la bonne foi et l\u2019ignorance de la loi ne constituent pas en elles-m\u00eames un motif valable pour justifier le retard \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une demande de prestations.Note de bas de page 1\n[16] Il est \u00e9galement bien \u00e9tabli que les prestataires qui tardent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestations parce que leur employeur a omis de leur remettre un relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi ne pr\u00e9sentent pas un motif valable de retard.Note de bas de page 2\n[17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne raisonnable et prudente dans la situation de la prestataire aurait fait des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de la Commission afin de se renseigner, surtout que la prestataire connaissait l\u2019existence de la Commission pour avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Elle a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait un motif valable justifiant le retard de sa demande initiale de prestations pendant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e.\n[18] Je ne vois aucune erreur r\u00e9visable commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[19] Je dois r\u00e9it\u00e9rer qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas permis \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel de tirer une conclusion diff\u00e9rente de celle de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur la foi des m\u00eames faits compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de sa comp\u00e9tence et de l\u2019absence d\u2019une erreur de droit, d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle ou de conclusion de fait arbitraire.Note de bas de page 3\n[20] La prestataire a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel au soutien de sa demande pour permission d\u2019en appeler.Note de bas de page 4 Or, cette d\u00e9cision ne s\u2019applique pas dans un dossier d\u2019antidatation.\n[21] La d\u00e9cision en question concerne un retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ce qui implique un autre test l\u00e9gal. La division d\u2019appel a retenu que la prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par un agent de la Commission qu\u2019elle pouvait d\u00e9poser sa demande d\u2019appel en retard. Pour ce motif, elle a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire afin de d\u00e9poser sa demande d\u2019appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[22] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. La prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\nConclusion [23] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nAlbrecht, A-172-85, Larouche, A-644-93, Carry, 2005 CAF 367, Somwaru, 2010 CAF 336, Kaler, 2011 CAF 266, Mauchel, 2012 CAF 202.\nNote de bas de page 2\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Chan, A-185-94; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Brace, 2008 CAF 118; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Ouimet, 2010 CAF 83.\nNote de bas de page 3\nQuadir c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CAF 21.\nNote de bas de page 4\nAD-23-999.\n",

Thomas\nMode d\u2019audience : T\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence\nDate de l\u2019audience : Le 18 janvier 2024\nPersonne pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 l\u2019audience : Appelant\nDate de la d\u00e9cision : Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2024\nNum\u00e9ro de dossier : GE-23-3165\nSur cette page\nD\u00e9cision Aper\u00e7u Questions que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9es en premier Question en litige Analyse Conclusion\nD\u00e9cision [1] L\u2019appel est accueilli en partie. Il est vrai que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait pendant une p\u00e9riode plus courte que ce que la Commission affirme.Note de bas de page 1\n[2] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler du 5 avril 2021 au 22 octobre 2021 au sens de la loi. Pour cette raison, je conclus que l\u2019appelant est inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n[3] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler du 23 octobre 2021 au 22 d\u00e9cembre 2021 au sens de la loi. Pour cette raison, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations pour cette p\u00e9riode. Il se peut donc que l\u2019appelant soit admissible \u00e0 des prestations.\nAper\u00e7u [4] La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi du 4 avril 2021 au 22 d\u00e9cembre 2021 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler. Une partie prestataire doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler pour recevoir des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. La disponibilit\u00e9 est une exigence continue. Cela signifie qu\u2019une partie prestataire doit \u00eatre \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi.\n[5] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler. L\u2019appelant doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler.\n[6] La Commission affirme que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible parce qu\u2019il suivait une formation \u00e0 temps plein.\n[7] L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. Il affirme qu\u2019il recevait des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une erreur soit commise dans une d\u00e9claration bimensuelle. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, on a \u00e9mis un avertissement relatif \u00e0 son dossier. Il a dit que la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019un agent de Service Canada l\u2019a contact\u00e9, on lui a dit que toutes les demandes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient d\u2019un traitement acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 en raison de la COVID. L\u2019agent lui a dit que toutes ses d\u00e9clarations \u00e9taient v\u00e9ridiques et qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e0 rembourser d\u2019argent. L\u2019appelant a dit qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cette conversation, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir des avis de dette. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9activ\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la fin de sa formation, alors qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de trouver du travail. Il a trouv\u00e9 un emploi depuis.\nQuestions que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9es en premier L\u2019appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [8] La Commission a d\u2019abord avis\u00e9 l\u2019appelant le 18 novembre 2021 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler. L\u2019appelant a d\u2019abord fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal en f\u00e9vrier 2022.\n[9] Le membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale affect\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appel a communiqu\u00e9 par courriel avec l\u2019appelant pour savoir pourquoi son appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la date limite.Note de bas de page 2 L\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u le courriel en raison d\u2019une erreur administrative : son adresse courriel se termine par \u00ab hotmail.ca \u00bb, mais on avait inscrit \u00ab hotmail.com \u00bb dans le syst\u00e8me du Tribunal. En l\u2019absence de r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019appelant, le membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de l\u2019erreur, a rejet\u00e9 son appel parce que celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en retard, et aucune explication raisonnable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie pour justifier le retard.\n[10] L\u2019appelant a appris que son appel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 plusieurs mois plus tard. Il a fait appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal. La division d\u2019appel a conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas eu droit \u00e0 un processus \u00e9quitable. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019erreur administrative quant \u00e0 son adresse courriel, il ne savait pas qu\u2019il devait fournir des renseignements sur les raisons du retard de son appel de f\u00e9vrier 2022. La division d\u2019appel a ordonn\u00e9 le renvoi de l\u2019appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour une nouvelle audience. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est le r\u00e9sultat de cette audience.\nL\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e deux fois [11] \u00c0 l\u2019origine, l\u2019audience devait avoir lieu le 4 janvier 2024. \u00c0 cette audience, on a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u le dossier de r\u00e9vision (portant le num\u00e9ro GD3) ni les observations de la Commission au Tribunal (portant le num\u00e9ro GD4) \u00e0 temps pour se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai report\u00e9 l\u2019audience au 12 janvier 2024 pour donner \u00e0 l\u2019appelant l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner les documents et de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[12] L\u2019audience du 12 janvier 2024 a d\u00fb \u00eatre report\u00e9e parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas pu prendre cong\u00e9 de son emploi. L\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 18 janvier 2024 et s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9vu.\nQuestion en litige [13] L\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il disponible pour travailler pendant qu\u2019il suivait sa formation?\nAnalyse [14] Deux articles de loi diff\u00e9rents exigent que les prestataires d\u00e9montrent leur disponibilit\u00e9 pour le travail.\n[15] Premi\u00e8rement, la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit que la Commission peut demander \u00e0 une partie prestataire de prouver qu\u2019elle fait des \u00ab d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables \u00bb pour trouver un emploi convenable.Note de bas de page 3 Le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e9nonce des crit\u00e8res qui aident \u00e0 expliquer ce que signifie \u00ab d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables \u00bb.Note de bas de page 4\n[16] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une personne doit prouver qu\u2019elle est \u00ab capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenable.Note de bas de page 5 La jurisprudence (d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux) donne trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments que la partie prestataire doit prouver pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle est \u00ab disponible \u00bb en ce sens.Note de bas de page 6\n[17] La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait inadmissible aux termes de ces deux articles. Elle affirme qu\u2019il doit remplir les crit\u00e8res des deux articles pour recevoir des prestations.\n[18] D\u2019autres r\u00e8gles s\u2019appliquent pour d\u00e9cider si les personnes qui \u00e9tudient sont disponibles pour travailler.\n[19] La jurisprudence, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux, indique que les prestataires qui sont aux \u00e9tudes ou qui suivent une formation \u00e0 temps plein sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s ne pas \u00eatre disponibles pour travailler.Note de bas de page 7 C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle la \u00ab pr\u00e9somption de non-disponibilit\u00e9 \u00bb. Cela signifie qu\u2019on pr\u00e9sume que les personnes qui \u00e9tudient ne sont pas disponibles pour travailler lorsque la preuve montre qu\u2019elles sont aux \u00e9tudes ou suivent une formation \u00e0 temps plein.\n[20] L\u2019appelant peut r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons. Il peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a l\u2019habitude de travailler \u00e0 temps plein tout en suivant une formationNote de bas de page 8 ou qu\u2019il a des circonstances exceptionnelles dans son cas.Note de bas de page 9\n[21] Je vais d\u2019abord d\u00e9cider si la pr\u00e9somption s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019appelant et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019il l\u2019a r\u00e9fut\u00e9e. Ensuite, je v\u00e9rifierai s\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible selon les deux articles de loi sur la disponibilit\u00e9.\nLa pr\u00e9somption ne s\u2019applique pas [22] La pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les personnes qui \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein ne sont pas disponibles pour travailler ne s\u2019applique pas. Voici les motifs de ma conclusion.\n[23] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19, le gouvernement a apport\u00e9 des modifications temporaires \u00e0 la loi pour aider les gens \u00e0 obtenir des prestations. Cela comprenait de nouvelles r\u00e8gles temporaires sur la disponibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudiants.Note de bas de page 10 Ces r\u00e8gles temporaires s\u2019appliquaient aux prestataires dont les p\u00e9riodes de prestations ont commenc\u00e9 entre le 27 septembre 2020 et le 25 septembre 2021.Note de bas de page 11\n[24] Les r\u00e8gles temporaires permettaient \u00e0 la Commission de verser des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pour les \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 condition qu\u2019ils puissent d\u00e9montrer leur disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler.Note de bas de page 12 Autrement dit, la loi indiquait que la Commission pouvait pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019un \u00e9tudiant \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler plut\u00f4t que non disponible, pourvu qu\u2019il puisse satisfaire \u00e0 une seule exigence : il devait prouver sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour chaque jour ouvrable de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations. Cela signifie qu\u2019en vertu des r\u00e8gles temporaires, la pr\u00e9somption de non-disponibilit\u00e9 des personnes qui \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prise en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer la disponibilit\u00e9 des personnes qui \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein.\n[25] La p\u00e9riode de prestations de l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 le 4 avril 2021, soit durant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 les r\u00e8gles temporaires \u00e9taient en vigueur. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9somption de non-disponibilit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une consid\u00e9ration qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 lui.\n[26] Les r\u00e8gles temporaires permettaient \u00e9galement \u00e0 la Commission de retarder la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie prestataire. Plut\u00f4t que de prendre cette d\u00e9cision lorsqu\u2019une personne demandait des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi (et avant de les verser), les r\u00e8gles temporaires permettaient \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019attendre apr\u00e8s le versement des prestations pour v\u00e9rifier l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9.Note de bas de page 13 C\u2019est ce que la Commission a fait dans le cas de l\u2019appelant lorsqu\u2019elle lui a vers\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi du 4 avril 2022 au 9 octobre 2021 et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 22 octobre 2021 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible en fin de compte.\nD\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi [27] En examinant les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier d\u2019appel, je constate que la Commission n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de prouver qu\u2019il avait fait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi convenable. La Commission n\u2019a m\u00eame jamais pr\u00e9tendu que la preuve de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait insuffisante.\n[28] Je remarque que la Commission n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation sur la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019il faisait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables. La Commission a seulement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u2019article 50(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[29] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019absence de preuve montrant que la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de prouver ses d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables aux termes de l\u2019article 50(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, je conclus que la Commission n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019appelant inadmissible aux termes de cet article. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019ai pas besoin de tenir compte de cette partie de la loi pour rendre ma d\u00e9cision sur cette question.\n[30] Je vais seulement v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 18 de la Loi.\nCapable de travailler et disponible pour le faire [31] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, je dois seulement v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.Note de bas de page 14 La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont je dois tenir compte pour rendre ma d\u00e9cision. L\u2019appelant doit prouver les trois choses suivantesNote de bas de page 15 :\na) Il voulait retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable lui serait offert. b) Il a fait des d\u00e9marches pour trouver un emploi convenable. c) Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de conditions personnelles qui auraient pu limiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler.\n[32] Lorsque j\u2019examine chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je dois examiner l\u2019attitude et la conduite de l\u2019appelant.Note de bas de page 16\nVouloir retourner travailler [33] L\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de travailler le 4 avril 2021. La Commission lui a dit le 22 octobre 2021 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations \u00e0 compter du 4 avril 2021. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher du travail lorsqu\u2019il a appris qu\u2019on allait arr\u00eater de lui verser des prestations; il a obtenu un emploi peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 son cours. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve indique que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au moment d\u2019apprendre que ses prestations allaient prendre fin (le 22 octobre 2021) que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il d\u00e9sirait retourner travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait retourner au travail d\u00e8s qu\u2019un emploi convenable lui serait offert. Ce n\u2019est que le 22 octobre 2021 qu\u2019il voulait retourner travailler.\n[34] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaille depuis 6 ans. Il travaillait avec un parent dans un emploi saisonnier et pour divers employeurs lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tudiait au secondaire et pendant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Il a obtenu son dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes secondaires en juin 2020 et a dit qu\u2019apr\u00e8s ses \u00e9tudes secondaires, il faisait des masques, puis il a obtenu un emploi dans une \u00e9picerie o\u00f9 il travaillait la fin de semaine et le soir pendant la semaine. Habituellement, il faisait cinq quarts de travail du dimanche au samedi, de 22 h \u00e0 8 h. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a des factures \u00e0 payer et qu\u2019il a besoin de l\u2019argent qu\u2019il re\u00e7oit en travaillant. Il a amorc\u00e9 une recherche d\u2019emploi, dont il est question ci-dessous, apr\u00e8s le 22 octobre 2021. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du 23 octobre 2021 qu\u2019il voulait retourner travailler d\u00e8s qu\u2019un emploi convenable lui serait offert.\nFaire des d\u00e9marches pour trouver un emploi convenable [35] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fait assez d\u2019efforts pour trouver un emploi convenable du 4 avril au 22 octobre 2021.\n[36] L\u2019appelant a fait des d\u00e9marches suffisantes pour trouver un emploi convenable \u00e0 compter du 23 octobre 2021.\n[37] Il y a une liste d\u2019activit\u00e9s de recherche d\u2019emploi \u00e0 examiner pour d\u00e9cider de la disponibilit\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un autre article de loi.Note de bas de page 17 Cet autre article ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant. Cependant, je choisis d\u2019examiner cette liste pour m\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a fait des efforts pour trouver un emploi convenable.Note de bas de page 18\n[38] La liste des activit\u00e9s de recherche d\u2019emploi comprend neuf activit\u00e9s : \u00e9valuer les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, r\u00e9diger un curriculum vitae ou une lettre d\u2019accompagnement, s\u2019inscrire \u00e0 des outils de recherche d\u2019emploi ou \u00e0 des banques d\u2019emploi ou des agences de placement en ligne, participer \u00e0 des ateliers de recherche d\u2019emploi ou \u00e0 des salons de l\u2019emploi, faire du r\u00e9seautage, communiquer avec des employeurs potentiels, pr\u00e9senter des demandes d\u2019emploi, participer \u00e0 des entrevues et faire l\u2019objet d\u2019\u00e9valuations de comp\u00e9tences.Note de bas de page 19\n[39] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que du moment o\u00f9 il a cess\u00e9 de travailler le 4 avril 2021 au moment o\u00f9 il a commenc\u00e9 son cours le 22 avril 2021, il \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole, \u00e0 acheter des livres et \u00e0 suivre une orientation de deux jours. Il a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait de recherches d\u2019emploi pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[40] Le 21 octobre 2021, l\u2019appelant a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un agent de Service Canada.Note de bas de page 20 Il lui a dit qu\u2019il ne cherchait pas un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Le 18 novembre 2021, l\u2019appelant a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre agent de Service Canada.Note de bas de page 21 Il lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas retourn\u00e9 chez son ancien employeur et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas postul\u00e9 ailleurs.\n[41] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a consult\u00e9 le Guichet-Emplois et le site Web InDeed pour trouver des emplois pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Il recevait des avis d\u2019emploi sur son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u un appel de Service Canada \u00e0 la fin d\u2019octobre; on lui a dit que son assurance-emploi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e. Il a dit qu\u2019en octobre 2021 ou en novembre 2021, apr\u00e8s la fin de son assurance-emploi, il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9picerie pour lui faire savoir qu\u2019il serait en mesure de travailler de 16 h \u00e0 22 h tous les jours. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a un curriculum vitae. En octobre, il a remis son curriculum vitae \u00e0 des commerces d\u2019un quartier voisin. Il a \u00e9galement remis son curriculum vitae \u00e0 des entreprises li\u00e9es \u00e0 son domaine dans sa communaut\u00e9 et dans les communaut\u00e9s voisines. Son curriculum vitae indiquait qu\u2019il terminerait sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de formation en f\u00e9vrier 2022. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 des parents, des camarades de classe et des amis au sujet des endroits o\u00f9 il pouvait chercher du travail. L\u2019appelant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un emploi dans son domaine peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de sa formation.\n[42] Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant contredit ce qu\u2019il a dit aux agents de Service Canada au sujet de ses d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi. Lorsque les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve se contredisent, je dois d\u00e9cider quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re. Ce faisant, je dois expliquer pourquoi je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.Note de bas de page 22\n[43] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la preuve que l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de ses d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi. En effet, le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis directement sous affirmation solennelle et j\u2019ai pu poser des questions pour clarifier la preuve, ce qui me semble plus fiable que le r\u00e9cit d\u2019un agent de Service Canada au sujet de ce dont il se souvenait des propos de l\u2019appelant.\n[44] Le dossier d\u2019appel montre que l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u un versement de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi le 13 octobre 2021. Il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un agent de Service Canada le 21 octobre 2021. Service Canada lui a envoy\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision initiale dans une lettre le 22 octobre 2021. Il a indiqu\u00e9 dans sa demande de r\u00e9vision que la d\u00e9cision lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e verbalement le 22 octobre 2021. Il n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de prestations le 24 octobre 2021, ce qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la prochaine date de traitement d\u2019un paiement. J\u2019en conclus que l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 sa recherche d\u2019emploi apr\u00e8s le 23 octobre 2021.\n[45] La p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tend du 4 avril 2021 au 22 d\u00e9cembre 2021.\n[46] Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que l\u2019appelant a fait des d\u00e9marches pour chercher du travail avant que prennent fin ses prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi le 22 octobre 2021. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que l\u2019appelant ne remplit pas les exigences pour ce facteur du 4 avril au 22 octobre 2021.\n[47] La preuve indique que l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 sa recherche d\u2019emploi le 23 octobre 2021. Dans le cadre de sa recherche d\u2019emploi, l\u2019appelant a communiqu\u00e9 avec son ancien employeur pour lui parler de son retour au travail, il a remis son curriculum vitae \u00e0 des employeurs potentiels et il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 des proches, \u00e0 des amis et \u00e0 des camarades de classe pour savoir o\u00f9 il pouvait trouver du travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant a fait assez d\u2019efforts \u00e0 partir du 25 octobre 2021 pour satisfaire \u00e0 ce facteur.\nLimiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler [48] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de conditions personnelles qui auraient pu limiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler.\n[49] Une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, appel\u00e9e Page, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas dans la jurisprudence (d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux) \u00ab de principe \u00e9tablissant l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 syst\u00e9matique de tous les \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 temps plein au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi s\u2019ils sont tenus d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sents en classe \u00e0 temps plein durant les jours ouvrables, soit du lundi au vendredi \u00bb.Note de bas de page 23 Dans la d\u00e9cision Page, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une erreur de droit de conclure qu\u2019une partie prestataire est disponible pour travailler si elle est disponible pour travailler conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son horaire de travail pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.Note de bas de page 24\n[50] L\u2019appelant a indiqu\u00e9 dans sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi que s\u2019il trouvait un emploi \u00e0 temps plein, il accepterait l\u2019emploi pourvu qu\u2019il puisse reporter la date de d\u00e9but le temps de terminer son cours. Il a dit \u00e0 un agent de Service Canada qu\u2019il n\u2019abandonnerait pas le cours s\u2019il recevait une offre d\u2019emploi qui entrait en conflit avec son horaire de cours.Note de bas de page 25 \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait dire qu\u2019il travaillerait \u00e0 temps plein le soir s\u2019il pouvait continuer ses \u00e9tudes.\n[51] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa formation avait lieu \u00e0 environ une heure de route de chez lui et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en classe jusqu\u2019\u00e0 14 h. Il a dit qu\u2019il aurait pu travailler de 15 h \u00e0 22 h ou \u00e0 23 h les jours de semaine et qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 disponible la fin de semaine. Il avait fait le quart de nuit de 22 h \u00e0 8 h les jours de semaine et le samedi soir avant de commencer son cours.\n[52] Je suis d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019appelant en classe jusqu\u2019\u00e0 14 h du lundi au vendredi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une condition personnelle qui limitait ind\u00fbment sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler. En effet, il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler apr\u00e8s 14 h et la fin de semaine, ce qui concorde avec ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail, car il travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel pendant ses \u00e9tudes secondaires et travaillait la nuit les jours de semaine et la fin de semaine apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 ses \u00e9tudes secondaires en juin 2020.\n[53] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a communiqu\u00e9 avec son ancien employeur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9picerie pour travailler apr\u00e8s la fin de ses prestations en octobre. Il a cherch\u00e9 du travail par le biais d\u2019InDeed et du Guichet-Emplois. Il a \u00e9galement cherch\u00e9 du travail dans des entreprises locales li\u00e9es \u00e0 son m\u00e9tier en distribuant son curriculum vitae. Son curriculum vitae indiquait qu\u2019il terminerait la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de sa formation en f\u00e9vrier 2022. L\u2019appelant suivait un programme d\u2019apprenti compos\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tapes d\u2019\u00e9tudes et d\u2019\u00e9tapes de travail. Rien ne laisse croire que le fait d\u2019avoir indiqu\u00e9 sur son curriculum vitae quand il aurait termin\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape d\u2019\u00e9tudes signifiait qu\u2019il pouvait travailler seulement apr\u00e8s cette date. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne pense pas qu\u2019il ait \u00e9tabli une condition personnelle en signalant que ses qualifications universitaires changeraient avec la fin de sa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de formation.\n[54] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de conditions personnelles quant aux heures qu\u2019il pouvait travailler qui auraient pu limiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner sur le march\u00e9 du travail.\nAlors, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire? [55] L\u2019appelant doit remplir les trois crit\u00e8res de la d\u00e9cision Faucher pour d\u00e9montrer sa disponibilit\u00e9.\n[56] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de mes conclusions sur les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s qu\u2019il satisfaisait aux trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019arr\u00eat Faucher pendant la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend du 5 avril au 22 octobre 2021.\n[57] Je conclus \u00e9galement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de mes conclusions sur les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019il a prouv\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenable du 23 octobre au 22 d\u00e9cembre 2021.\nConclusion [58] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler du 5 avril 2021 au 22 octobre 2021 au sens de la loi. Pour cette raison, je conclus que l\u2019appelant est inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n[59] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler du 23 octobre 2021 au 22 d\u00e9cembre 2021 au sens de la loi. Pour cette raison, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations pour cette p\u00e9riode. Il se peut donc que l\u2019appelant soit admissible aux prestations.\n[60] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli en partie.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nUne personne qui demande et re\u00e7oit des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi est appel\u00e9e \u00ab prestataire \u00bb.

Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res le 23 juin 2020. Le 20 juillet 2020, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) a avis\u00e9 le prestataire qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas \u00e9tablir une p\u00e9riode de prestations parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait cumul\u00e9 aucune heure d\u2019emploi assurable entre le 16 juin 2019 et le 27 juin 2020.\n[3] Le 28 septembre 2022, le prestataire a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pr\u00e9vu pour faire cette demande. Il a indiqu\u00e9 que le calcul des heures d\u2019emploi assurable est bas\u00e9 sur les douze derniers mois alors que, dans son cas, c calcul aurait d\u00fb se concentrer sur les revenus qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u en 2019. L\u2019e prestataire affirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir la Prestation canadienne d\u2019urgence (PCU).\n[4] Le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2023, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le prestataire qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9viserait pas la d\u00e9cision rendue le 20 juillet 2020. Elle a conclu que les motifs fournis par le prestataire pour justifier son retard \u00e0 d\u00e9poser sa demande de r\u00e9vision ne rencontraient pas les exigences du R\u00e8glement sur les demandes de r\u00e9vision. Le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[5] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 la demande de prolongation de d\u00e9lai du prestataire afin de demander une r\u00e9vision.\n[6] Le prestataire demande maintenant \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Au soutien de sa permission d\u2019en appeler, il fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de comp\u00e9tence. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi mais qu\u2019il a plut\u00f4t fait une demande pour la PCU.\n[7] Je dois d\u00e9cider si on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[8] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par le prestataire ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [9] Est-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [10] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[11] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[12] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s? [13] Le prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de comp\u00e9tence. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi mais qu\u2019il a plut\u00f4t fait une demande pour la PCU. Il fait valoir que la Commission a commis une erreur dans l'\u00e9tude de son dossier d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de sa demande en 2020. Il fait valoir que leur refus \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur une erreur de jugement et de compr\u00e9hension de sa demande.\n[14] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire n\u2019a pas cumul\u00e9 d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable entre le 16 juin 2019 et le 27 juin 2020. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied par son employeur, en avril 2019 et il a re\u00e7u des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi jusqu\u2019en juin 2020.\n[15] En date du 23 juin 2020, le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.Note de bas de page 1 Entre le 15 mars 2020 et le 3 octobre 2020, toutes les demandes de prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies en prestations d\u2019urgence.Note de bas de page 2\n[16] En date du 21 juillet 2020, il a re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision initiale de la Commission lui refusant des prestations puisqu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas accumul\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019heures pour se qualifier.Note de bas de page 3\n[17] En date du 26 septembre 2022, le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande en r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision initiale de la Commission. Il explique son retard \u00e0 d\u00e9poser sa demande par le fait qu\u2019il vient de comprendre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir la PCU \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait gagn\u00e9 un salaire de plus de 5 000 $ en 2019.Note de bas de page 4\n[18] Au soutien de sa demande d\u2019appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le prestataire a fait valoir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 la PCU et que la Commission lu a refus\u00e9 c droit. Il explique ne pas avoir fait sa demande de r\u00e9vision dans les d\u00e9lais parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de nouveau \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui lui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9tayer sa demande.Note de bas de page 5\n[19] Le prestataire fait valoir que la Commission avait le pouvoir de lui accorder de la PCU au moment de sa demande. Il se devait alors de pr\u00e9senter une demande de r\u00e9vision dans les 30 jours suivants la r\u00e9ception de la d\u00e9cision initiale lui refusant des prestations.\n[20] Le prestataire a re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cision initiale le 20 juillet 2020. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande de r\u00e9vision le 28 septembre 2022. Sa demande de r\u00e9vision est en retard de plus de 790 jours.\n[21] La question en litige devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernait justement le d\u00e9faut du prestataire de d\u00e9poser sa demande de r\u00e9vision aupr\u00e8s de la Commission dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit de 30 jours.\n[22] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider si la Commission avait exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a rejet\u00e9 la demande visant \u00e0 prolonger le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pour la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une demande de r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision initiale.Note de bas de page 6 Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la preuve du prestataire, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission avait correctement eu recours \u00e0 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[23] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019explication raisonnable pour le retard de plus de 790 jours dans la pr\u00e9sentation de sa demande de r\u00e9vision. Elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le prestataire n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention constante de poursuivre son appel parce qu\u2019il a entam\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches uniquement apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir la PCU. Il a m\u00eame tard\u00e9 au 28 septembre 2022 pour pr\u00e9senter sa demande apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 la PCU.\n[24] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments pertinents \u00e0 la situation du prestataire. Avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision, elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le prestataire prenait soin de sa conjointe malade et elle a \u00e9galement consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les arguments du prestataire concernant la PCU. La division G\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de mani\u00e8re judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour demander une r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision initiale.\n[25] \u00c0 la lecture de la demande pour permission d\u2019en appeler, je comprends tr\u00e8s bien que le prestataire reproche \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa demande, manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de l\u2019informer de son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la PCU et que cela l\u2019a priv\u00e9 de recevoir la PCU. Cependant, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour ordonner le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice subi \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un manquement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la Commission. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un d\u00e9bat qui rel\u00e8ve d\u2019un autre forum.Note de bas de page 7\n[26] Au soutien de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 d\u2019erreur de comp\u00e9tence ou de manquement \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle de la part de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il n\u2019a pas identifi\u00e9 d\u2019erreurs de droit ou de conclusions de fait erron\u00e9es que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait tir\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[27] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, et apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments du prestataire au soutien de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je me dois de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [28] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e.

L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC).\nAper\u00e7u [2] L\u2019appelant est un ancien ma\u00e7on de 62 ans qui a des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u2019hypertension et de diab\u00e8te. \u00c0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990, il s\u2019est cass\u00e9 la jambe droite, ce qui a nui \u00e0 sa mobilit\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019emploi \u00e0 temps plein depuis 2011 et n\u2019a travaill\u00e9 que de fa\u00e7on intermittente depuis.\n[3] L\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC le 29 novembre 2012Note de bas page 1. Le ministre a rejet\u00e9 la demande apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas atteint d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 pendant sa p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 (PMA), qui a pris fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013. Le 19 mai 2016, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal a maintenu le refus du ministre et, le 29 ao\u00fbt 2017, la division d\u2019appel a refus\u00e9 la permission de faire appel.\n[4] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC le 28 janvier 2022. Le ministre a de nouveau rejet\u00e9 sa demande et la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, son appel. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019en raison d\u2019un principe de droit connu sous le nom de chose jug\u00e9e, elle n\u2019avait pas le droit de trancher une question qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite.\n[5] L\u2019appelant a ensuite demand\u00e9 la permission de faire appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel. L\u2019an dernier, une de mes coll\u00e8gues de la division d\u2019appel l\u2019a accord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019appelant, j\u2019ai tranch\u00e9 cette question en me fondant sur un examen du dossier \u00e9crit.\nQuestions en litige [6] Dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, je devais r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 trois questions :\nLe principe de la chose jug\u00e9e m\u2019emp\u00eache-t-il d\u2019examiner la demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC de l\u2019appelant? Si le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s\u2019applique pas, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il atteint d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013? L\u2019appelant est-il admissible \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite?\nAnalyse [7] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des deux parties, j\u2019ai conclu que je ne peux pas examiner la demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant.\nLe principe de la chose jug\u00e9e emp\u00eache que cette affaire soit entendue \u00e0 nouveau [8] Un principe juridique bien \u00e9tabli appel\u00e9 la chose jug\u00e9e emp\u00eache les cours et les tribunaux d\u2019examiner des affaires qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce principe s\u2019applique sp\u00e9cifiquement aux d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 socialeNote de bas page 2.\n[9] Dans l\u2019affaire Danyluk, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 que le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e repose sur des motifs d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qui sont judicieux :\nUne fois tranch\u00e9, un diff\u00e9rend ne devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 nouveau aux tribunaux au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la partie d\u00e9bout\u00e9e et au d\u00e9triment de la partie qui a eu gain de cause. Une personne ne devrait \u00eatre tracass\u00e9e qu\u2019une seule fois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une m\u00eame cause d\u2019action. Les instances faisant double emploi, les risques de r\u00e9sultats contradictoires, les frais excessifs et les proc\u00e9dures non d\u00e9cisives doivent \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9sNote de bas page 3.\n[10] Il y a des exceptions au principe, mais l\u2019appelant ne satisfait \u00e0 aucune de celles-ci.\nUne affaire ne peut pas \u00eatre entendue \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle soit consid\u00e9rablement diff\u00e9rente de la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente [11] La d\u00e9cision Danyluk a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une analyse en deux \u00e9tapes pour appliquer le principe de la chose jug\u00e9eNote de bas page 4. Premi\u00e8rement, les conditions suivantes doivent \u00eatre remplies :\nL\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente doit impliquer les m\u00eames parties que l\u2019instance actuelle; Les deux instances doivent aborder les m\u00eames questions; L\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente doit avoir men\u00e9 \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision finale.\n[12] Deuxi\u00e8mement, m\u00eame si ces trois conditions sont remplies, la d\u00e9cision Danyluk accorde aux d\u00e9cideuses et aux d\u00e9cideurs un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire quant \u00e0 l\u2019application du principe de la chose jug\u00e9e. Toutefois, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments tels que :\nles circonstances qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente; le libell\u00e9 du texte de loi; l\u2019objet de la loi; l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel; les garanties offertes aux parties sur le plan administratif; l\u2019expertise de la d\u00e9cideuse ou du d\u00e9cideur sur le plan administratif; le risque d\u2019injustice.\n[13] En appliquant l\u2019analyse de Danyluk, je conclus que la question de la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 travailler avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. Je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 me servir de mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour entendre cette affaire \u00e0 nouveau.\nLe pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur des questions que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a abord\u00e9es dans sa d\u00e9cision de mai 2016 [14] Le 17 mai 2016, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas atteint d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[15] Je ne peux pas revenir sur cette d\u00e9cision parce que le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e m\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019examiner des questions que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la d\u00e9cision rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en mai 2016 remplit les conditions suivantes :\nElle implique les m\u00eames parties, soit l\u2019appelant et le ministre; Elle s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur la m\u00eame question, soit la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013; Elle est finale, car l\u2019appelant n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[16] De plus, la preuve m\u00e9dicale concernant l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents professionnels de l\u2019appelant avant le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013 est essentiellement la m\u00eame dans toutes ses demandes.\n[17] Les trois conditions de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de Danyluk sont remplies. Pour ce qui est des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape, je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas appliquer le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tenu une audience par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence durant laquelle l\u2019appelant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. Le membre qui a entendu sa cause a expliqu\u00e9 les questions en d\u00e9tail, et je suis convaincu que l\u2019appelant connaissait la cause qu\u2019il devait pr\u00e9senter. Je ne peux pas dire qu\u2019on l\u2019a priv\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir sa demande de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC \u00e9valu\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable. Je ne vois aucune injustice \u00e0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nJe ne peux pas d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait atteint d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2013 [18] Les personnes qui demandent une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC doivent habituellement d\u00e9montrer que leur invalidit\u00e9 \u00e9tait grave et prolong\u00e9e pendant leur p\u00e9riode de couverture. Toutefois, je ne peux pas examiner cette question ici parce que, tel que mentionn\u00e9, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e il y a pr\u00e8s de huit ans.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite [19] La prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite est une prestation relativement nouvelle qui est con\u00e7ue pour offrir une protection contre l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 aux personnes qui cotisent au RPC qui n\u2019ont pas atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans. Pour recevoir cette prestation, les personnes pr\u00e9sentant une demande doivent \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une PMA en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elles ont vers\u00e9 des cotisations au RPC \u00e0 des moments pr\u00e9cisNote de bas page 5.\n[20] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, puisque l\u2019appelant a accumul\u00e9 plus de 25 ann\u00e9es de gains au total, il devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a vers\u00e9 des cotisations au RPC pendant trois des six ann\u00e9es civiles qui venaient imm\u00e9diatement avant la date de sa demandeNote de bas page 6. L\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 le 28 janvier 2022, mais son registre ne contient aucune cotisation pour les ann\u00e9es de 2016 \u00e0 2021 inclusivementNote de bas page 7. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019a pas de PMA aux fins de la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite.\nConclusion [21] Le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e s\u2019applique \u00e0 la demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelant.

L\u2019appel ne se poursuivra pas. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] S. M., le requ\u00e9rant, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir une pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en juin 2021. Il a ensuite demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada le 23 septembre 2022. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, comme elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e plus de 15 mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du versement de sa pension de retraiteNote de bas de page 1.\n[3] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas non plus eu droit \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite du fait que sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 avait pris fin avant la prise d\u2019effet de cette prestation, en janvier 2019. Les r\u00e8gles concernant les p\u00e9riodes de protection permettant de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite ont chang\u00e9 en mai 2023, mais le requ\u00e9rant y demeurait inadmissible.\n[4] Le requ\u00e9rant a fait appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 son appel, concluant que le requ\u00e9rant ne pouvait :\nni faire annuler sa pension de retraite au profit d\u2019une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9; ni \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite.\nQuestions en litige [5] Voici les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel :\na) Est-il d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019ait pas offert au requ\u00e9rant une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable? b) Est-il d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait en ignorant la preuve concernant les raisons pour lesquelles le requ\u00e9rant avait demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 plus de 15 mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada? c) Le requ\u00e9rant pr\u00e9sente-t-il, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [6] Je peux accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019ait pas assur\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; ait outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou ait refus\u00e9 de les exercer; ait commis une erreur de droit; ait commis une erreur de fait; ait commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 2.\n[7] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 3.\n[8] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait omis d\u2019offrir au requ\u00e9rant une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable [9] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait injusteNote de bas de page 4.\n[10] \u00c0 mon avis, le requ\u00e9rant se demande si l\u2019application des conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite, compte tenu des dates, a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat \u00e9quitable dans son cas. Il met l\u2019accent sur tous les obstacles freinant l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada du fait que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 cette pension d\u00e9pend d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de protection (laquelle est \u00e9tablie d\u2019apr\u00e8s les cotisations au r\u00e9gime).\n[11] Je peux seulement donner la permission de faire appel si le requ\u00e9rant montre qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle erreur ici. La question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par requ\u00e9rant ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la proc\u00e9dure.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait en ignorant les raisons pour lesquelles le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t [12] Le requ\u00e9rant fait valoir que de r\u00e9els obstacles l\u2019ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de demander une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a fait. Il explique avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande rapidement une fois que son diagnostic s\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 et qu\u2019il s\u2019est rendu compte qu\u2019il ne pourrait pas travailler en raison d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9.\n[13] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 une erreur de fait d\u00e9fendable imputable \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale mentionne les raisons pour lesquelles il a pris du temps \u00e0 demander la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Elle a not\u00e9 qu\u2019il craignait que le ministre lui demande des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux m\u00eame s\u2019il savait qu\u2019il ne serait pas admissible \u00e0 la pension, vu le moment o\u00f9 il avait fait sa demandeNote de bas de page 5.\n[14] On ne peut pas soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait ignor\u00e9 ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les raisons que le requ\u00e9rant a donn\u00e9es pour avoir fait sa demande plus de 15 mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du versement de sa pension de retraite. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mentionn\u00e9 ces raisons, mais a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que la loi s\u2019appliquait quand m\u00eame au requ\u00e9rant : il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande trop tard pour faire remplacer sa pension de retraite par une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant touchait sa pension de retraite depuis le 1er juin 2021. Il avait ensuite demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 le 23 septembre 2022. Plus de 15 mois s\u2019\u00e9taient donc \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis le d\u00e9but de sa pension de retraiteNote de bas de page 6.\n[15] Le requ\u00e9rant ne pr\u00e9tend pas qu\u2019il aurait fait sa demande avant le 23 septembre 2022. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le requ\u00e9rant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande trop tard, et le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019elle aurait commis une erreur en parvenant \u00e0 cette conclusion. Je ne vois aucune erreur possible dans la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant le fait que la demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e trop tard.\nLa requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve [16] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne peut donc pas justifier de lui donner la permission de faire appel.\n[17] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la preuve concernant la date o\u00f9 le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 ou concernant sa p\u00e9riode de protection aux fins d\u2019une prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraiteNote de bas de page 7.\n[18] M\u00eame si le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019erreur pr\u00e9cise quant \u00e0 son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s-retraite, je suis convaincue qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait err\u00e9 en la mati\u00e8re. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 les cotisations du requ\u00e9rant quand il a demand\u00e9 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, en 2022, et lorsqu\u2019il touchait sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en 2021. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas assez cotis\u00e9 pour y \u00eatre admissible en 2021 ni en 2022Note de bas de page 8.\nConclusion [19] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, son appel ne se poursuivra pas.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir les paragraphes 14 \u00e0 16 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, o\u00f9 celle-ci explique comment les articles 42(2)(b), 44(b) et 66.1 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada s\u2019appliquent conjointement pour permettre aux requ\u00e9rants d\u2019annuler une pension de retraite au profit d\u2019une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, mais seulement si le requ\u00e9rant est r\u00e9put\u00e9 invalide avant le mois o\u00f9 sa pension de retraite est devenue payable.

Une p\u00e9riode de prestations a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 compter du 5 f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[3] Le 26 avril 2023, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 partir du 29 janvier 2023, parce qu\u2019il a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi pour l\u2019employeur sans motif valable au sens de la loi. Le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas eu le choix de cesser de travailler pour l\u2019employeur. Il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail en raison de probl\u00e8me m\u00e9canique sur sa voiture et que, compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e2ge du v\u00e9hicule, il \u00e9tait inutile de la faire r\u00e9parer.

Il connaissait ses conditions d\u2019emploi et les a accept\u00e9es. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire aurait pu discuter avec son employeur avant de quitter son emploi pour tenter de trouver une solution \u00e0 son probl\u00e8me de transport. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi au sens de la loi.\nQuestion en litige [5] La loi sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[6] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[7] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas la permission de faire appel au prestataire [8] Le prestataire fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte du contexte. Il n\u2019avait plus de moyen de transport pour se rendre au travail situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de 30 km de chez lui. L\u2019endroit est inaccessible en transport en commun. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il faut faire preuve d\u2019humanit\u00e9 et aller plus loin que le texte de la loi.\n[9] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que lorsque le prestataire a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019employeur, en novembre 2021, il savait qu\u2019il avait besoin d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule pour se rendre au travail, soit \u00e0 une trentaine de kilom\u00e8tres de sa r\u00e9sidence. Il connaissait ses conditions d\u2019emploi et les a accept\u00e9es. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire aurait pu discuter avec son employeur avant de quitter son emploi pour tenter de trouver une solution \u00e0 son probl\u00e8me de transport. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi au sens de la loi.\n[10] Le prestataire a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter son emploi \u00e0 la suite d'un bris m\u00e9canique de son auto rendant le transport au travail difficile sinon sur le moment impossible, ce qui n'est pas en soi un motif valable reconnu par la loi. Tel que soulign\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le prestataire n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de discuter avec son employeur afin de palier \u00e0 cette difficult\u00e9. Il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 une obligation stricte que la loi lui imposait et de ce fait est inadmissible aux prestations d'assurance-emploi.\n[11] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9part volontaire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le prestataire, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, n\u2019avait d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi.\n[12] Un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une occasion pour le prestataire de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa position et d\u2019esp\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Je constate que le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit ou de fait ou de comp\u00e9tence dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [14] La permission de faire appel n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.",

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] T. M., la requ\u00e9rante, a cess\u00e9 de travailler comme aide g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de cuisine et a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir cette pension en janvier 2006. En 2013, la requ\u00e9rante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle a ensuite travaill\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied durant la pand\u00e9mie.\n[3] Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante en juillet 2020 pour lui expliquer qu\u2019il examinait son dossier. Le ministre a recueilli des renseignements concernant les gains de la requ\u00e9rante. En ao\u00fbt 2021, il lui a fait savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible aux prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7ues apr\u00e8s avril 2018.\n[4] La requ\u00e9rante a fait appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel, jugeant que le ministre avait prouv\u00e9 que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019\u00e9tait plus invalide au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada apr\u00e8s avril 2018.\n[5] La requ\u00e9rante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel contestant la d\u00e9cision rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 1. La requ\u00e9rante a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre invalide. Selon elle, le versement de sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 n\u2019aurait jamais d\u00fb cesser.\nQuestion en litige [6] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait-elle avoir commis une erreur justifiant de donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel? b) La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9sente-t-elle, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui justifieraient de lui donner la permission de faire appel?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [7] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas page 2.\n[8] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle pr\u00e9sente dans sa demande des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 3.\n[9] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019argument d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui justifieraient de lui accorder la permission de faire appel, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur [10] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a montr\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019aucune erreur d\u00e9fendable commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui lui donnerait une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Elle fait valoir que son invalidit\u00e9 limite ses revenus possibles. Elle ne pense pas que sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb cesserNote de bas page 4.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider si la requ\u00e9rante avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019avoir une invalidit\u00e9 grave au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en 2018. La pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 cesse d\u2019\u00eatre payable lorsque la personne cesse d\u2019avoir une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du CanadaNote de bas page 5. Il revient au ministre de prouver qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que la requ\u00e9rante a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre invalide quand il a cess\u00e9 de lui verser des prestations, en avril 2018Note de bas page 6.\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu ce qui suitNote de bas page 7 :\nLa requ\u00e9rante a travaill\u00e9 comme aide g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de cuisine d\u2019octobre 2015 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2018. Elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler en raison d\u2019un manque de travail. En 2013, en 2014 et en 2015, elle a gagn\u00e9 moins de 6 000 $. Elle a toutefois gagn\u00e9 12 159 $ en 2016 et 11 868 $ en 2017. De d\u00e9cembre 2018 \u00e0 avril 2020, la requ\u00e9rante a travaill\u00e9 comme aide g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans une autre cuisine, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied durant la pand\u00e9mie. Elle travaillait 37,5 heures par semaine et gagnait 15,25 $ l\u2019heure. En 2018, la requ\u00e9rante a gagn\u00e9 16 542 $. En 2019, elle a gagn\u00e9 29 842 $. Selon le R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada de 2018, une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u2019au moins 16 029,96 $ est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice. Pour 2019, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration minimale devait \u00eatre de 16 347,60 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019occupation de la requ\u00e9rante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice pour ces deux ann\u00e9es. La requ\u00e9rante avait travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on continue et sa pr\u00e9sence au travail \u00e9tait bonne. Elle avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de certaines mesures d\u2019adaptation. On lui permettait de s\u2019asseoir au besoin et elle ne devait pas marcher beaucoup. Toutefois, les attentes relatives \u00e0 son emploi n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duites dans la m\u00eame proportion que l'aurait fait un employeur bienveillant. Compte tenu de son \u00e2ge, de sa scolarit\u00e9, de ses aptitudes en anglais et de son exp\u00e9rience dans le secteur de la restauration, la requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait employable dans un contexte r\u00e9aliste en 2018.\n[13] Le ministre a convaincu la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019\u00e9tait plus, en avril 2018, r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement incapable de d\u00e9tenir une occupation v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice. En 2018 et en 2019, elle avait travaill\u00e9 continuellement comme aide de cuisine \u00e0 temps plein et gagn\u00e9 un revenu exc\u00e9dant le minimum requis pour une occupation v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice.\n[14] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a invoqu\u00e9 aucune erreur que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait pu commettre dans sa d\u00e9cision quant au travail qu\u2019elle a fait \u00e0 compter de 2018 et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e8le sur sa capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 gagner sa vie malgr\u00e9 ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9.\n[15] Je ne peux pas donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel. La nature de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et ses limitations actuelles pour travailler ne sont pas pertinentes \u00e0 la question que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait trancher.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve qui n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [16] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la permission d\u2019en appeler ne peut lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9e sur la base d\u2019une nouvelle preuve.\n[17] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossierNote de bas page 8. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve au dossier quant \u00e0 la nature du travail exerc\u00e9 par la requ\u00e9rante et au fait qu\u2019il r\u00e9v\u00e8le que son invalidit\u00e9 n\u2019est plus grave au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. La preuve montre que la requ\u00e9rante a gagn\u00e9 un revenu v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur en 2018 et en 2019. Je ne vois aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait rat\u00e9 ou mal compris en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son revenu, au travail qu\u2019elle a accompli ou \u00e0 sa fiabilit\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, je ne vois aucune preuve \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de laquelle elle serait pass\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si la requ\u00e9rante b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait d\u2019un employeur bienveillant.\nConclusion [18] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a occup\u00e9 un emploi chez X qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2020. Le 20 janvier 2021, il a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) avoir quitt\u00e9 cet emploi pour un autre emploi chez X qui devait commencer le 19 janvier 2021. Puis, le 14 octobre 2021, le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission avoir quitt\u00e9 son emploi le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2020, pour aller travailler pour X et X. Il a dit que cet emploi avait commenc\u00e9 le 5 janvier 2021.\n[3] En date du 19 octobre 2021, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le prestataire a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi sans justification. Elle a exclu le prestataire du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations \u00e0 compter du 6 d\u00e9cembre 2020. Cela a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un trop-pay\u00e9.\n[4] Le prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de r\u00e9vision le 17 mars 2022. Il a fait valoir qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un emploi pour X et X lorsqu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi chez X. En date du 22 avril 2022, la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale quant au d\u00e9part volontaire.\n[5] Le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me demande de r\u00e9vision le 9 juin 2023. Dans sa d\u00e9cision du 13 juillet 2023, la Commission indique qu\u2019elle ne reconsid\u00e9rera pas sa d\u00e9cision parce que plus de 30 jours se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la d\u00e9cision du 22 avril 2022 et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019explication pour justifier le d\u00e9lai. Le 6 aout 2023, le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision de la Commission devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal.\n[6] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019appliquer la loi qui \u00e9dicte que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut proroger d\u2019au plus un an le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel \u00e0 la suite de la communication de la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision du 22 avril 2022.Note de bas de page 1 L\u2019appel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 instruit.\n[7] Le prestataire demande maintenant \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler relativement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi chez X parce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019assurance d\u2019un autre emploi chez X.\n[8] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[9] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par le prestataire ne conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [10] Est-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ?\nAnalyse [11] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[12] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[13] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s ? [14] Le prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi chez X parce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 l\u2019assurance d\u2019un autre emploi chez X avant de quitter.\n[15] Au soutien de son appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les revenus qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9 pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait quitt\u00e9 X pour un autre emploi en janvier 2021.\n[16] La question en litige devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernait une exclusion d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e au prestataire en vertu des articles 29 et 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi parce qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi sans justification.\n[17] La d\u00e9cision sur le litige dont il est question ici a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en r\u00e9vision par la Commission le 22 avril 2022. La d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision mentionne que le prestataire a 30 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de la d\u00e9cision pour faire appel au Tribunal.\n[18] Lors de l\u2019audience, le prestataire a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait bien re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision en question. Il n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de contestation de cette d\u00e9cision devant le Tribunal car il jugeait ne pas \u00eatre pr\u00eat. Il avait besoin de discuter avec des gens et de rassembler sa preuve.\n[19] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le prestataire avait re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision de la Commission vers le 2 mai 2022. Elle a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que le prestataire a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le 6 aout 2023.\n[20] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019appliquer la loi qui \u00e9dicte que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut proroger d\u2019au plus un an le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel \u00e0 la suite de la communication de la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision.Note de bas de page 2 L\u2019appel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 instruit.\n[21] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision de la Commission au mois de mai 2022. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son avis d\u2019appel que le 6 ao\u00fbt 2023, soit 14 mois plus tard.\n[22] Il s\u2019est donc \u00e9coul\u00e9 plus d\u2019un an entre le moment o\u00f9 le prestataire a re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision rendue par la Commission et le moment o\u00f9 le prestataire en a d\u00fbment fait appel aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[23] Je sympathise avec le prestataire. Cependant, il est clairement pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 la loi que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne peut proroger de plus d\u2019un an le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel. Compte tenu de son retard de plus d\u2019un an \u00e0 d\u00e9poser son appel, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne pouvait pas entendre sa contestation sur le d\u00e9part volontaire.\n[24] La loi ne conf\u00e8re malheureusement pas au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de proroger de plus d\u2019un an le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.Note de bas de page 3\n[25] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019appel, la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et les arguments du prestataire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [26] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir article 52(2) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 52(2) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 3\nB.

Conclusion\nD\u00e9cision [1] La permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a perdu son emploi de chauffeur. L\u2019employeur du prestataire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait harcel\u00e9 sexuellement l\u2019employ\u00e9e d\u2019une cliente pendant son trajet de livraison. Le prestataire a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais harcel\u00e9 sexuellement personne. Il a fait valoir qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il voulait changer de trajet et qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 une augmentation.\n[3] La d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) a conclu que le prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait harcel\u00e9 sexuellement l\u2019employ\u00e9e d\u2019une cliente pendant son trajet de livraison. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le prestataire avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Elle l\u2019a donc exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision, la Commission n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision. Le prestataire a fait appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire avait perdu son emploi parce qu\u2019il avait harcel\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9e d\u2019une cliente. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a estim\u00e9 que le prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il pouvait perdre son emploi puisqu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u des avertissements. Elle a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la raison pour laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli que le prestataire avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\n[5] Le prestataire cherche maintenant \u00e0 obtenir la permission de faire appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel.On a demand\u00e9 au prestataire de fournir ses moyens d\u2019appel avant le 15 novembre 2023. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Il a obtenu une prolongation du d\u00e9lai pour pr\u00e9senter ses moyens d\u2019appel. Il avait donc jusqu\u2019au 5 d\u00e9cembre 2023. \u00c0 ce jour, le prestataire n\u2019avait toujours pas fourni ses moyens d\u2019appel.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si le prestataire a soulev\u00e9 une erreur r\u00e9visable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commise et qui pourrait donner \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance de succ\u00e8s.\n[7] Je refuse la permission de faire appel, car l\u2019appel du prestataire n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [8] Le prestataire soul\u00e8ve-t-il une erreur r\u00e9visable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commise et qui pourrait donner \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [9] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social pr\u00e9voit les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il s\u2019agit des erreurs r\u00e9visables suivantes :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher ou elle a tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de trancher. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] La demande de permission de faire appel est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 l\u2019examen sur le fond. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais o\u00f9 le crit\u00e8re juridique est moins exigeant que celui \u00e0 remplir pour un appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la permission de faire appel, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver ses arguments. Il doit plut\u00f4t \u00e9tablir que l\u2019appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s en raison d\u2019une erreur r\u00e9visable. Autrement dit, il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est possible de soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu une erreur r\u00e9visable pouvant faire en sorte que l\u2019appel soit accueilli.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, avant d\u2019accorder la permission de faire appel, je dois \u00eatre convaincu que les motifs de l\u2019appel correspondent \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des moyens d\u2019appel mentionn\u00e9s plus haut et qu\u2019au moins un des motifs donne \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nLe prestataire soul\u00e8ve-t-il une erreur r\u00e9visable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commise et qui pourrait donner \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance de succ\u00e8s? [12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider si le prestataire avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\n[13] Le r\u00f4le de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est de d\u00e9cider si la conduite d\u2019une personne employ\u00e9e constitue une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Son r\u00f4le n\u2019est pas de juger de la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de la sanction impos\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur, \u00e0 savoir si elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e, ni de d\u00e9cider si la conduite de la personne employ\u00e9e \u00e9tait un motif valable de cong\u00e9diement.\n[14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit trancher la question dont elle est saisie en se fondant sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties.\n[15] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire avait perdu son emploi parce qu\u2019il avait harcel\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9e d\u2019une cliente pendant son trajet de livraison. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a estim\u00e9 que le prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il pouvait perdre son emploi puisqu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u des avertissements. Elle a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la raison pour laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli que le prestataire avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\n[16] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a accord\u00e9 plus d\u2019importance \u00e0 la preuve de l\u2019employeur. Elle a tenu compte du fait que le prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le jour ayant suivi celui o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur a re\u00e7u une plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel commis par l\u2019un de ses chauffeurs envers l\u2019employ\u00e9e d\u2019une cliente et o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9 par la police. Elle a \u00e9galement tenu compte du fait que la preuve de l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e par la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, le courriel de la cliente et la preuve d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur \u00e0 la suite de la plainte.\n[17] La preuve montre que le prestataire savait que le harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait inacceptable. Il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u des avertissements, dont un pour harc\u00e8lement de la client\u00e8le. La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale appuie sa conclusion selon laquelle le prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que ses actions pouvaient mener \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement.\n[18] Je ne vois aucune erreur r\u00e9visable commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle a rendu sa d\u00e9cision en se fondant sur la preuve dont elle disposait, et la d\u00e9cision est conforme aux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et \u00e0 la jurisprudence relatives \u00e0 l\u2019inconduite.\n[19] Malheureusement pour le prestataire, un appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une nouvelle audience o\u00f9 une partie peut pr\u00e9senter de nouveau des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en esp\u00e9rant obtenir une d\u00e9cision qui lui est favorable.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dossier d\u2019appel, la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ainsi que les arguments que le prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour appuyer sa demande de permission de faire appel, je n\u2019ai pas d\u2019autre choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Le prestataire n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 de motif qui correspond \u00e0 l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des moyens d\u2019appel mentionn\u00e9s plus haut et qui pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\nConclusion [21] La permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.",

Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelante.\n[2] Elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi quand elle l\u2019a fait (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle avait une raison acceptable selon la loi). Son d\u00e9part n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 parce que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\nAper\u00e7u [3] L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires. En septembre 2021, elle a entrepris un programme de deux ans pour devenir infirmi\u00e8re auxiliaire autoris\u00e9e. Durant sa premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9tudes, elle a continu\u00e9 de travailler comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires.\n[4] Mais la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e de son programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes, qui a commenc\u00e9 en septembre 2022, \u00e9tait plus exigeante.\n[5] Elle a donc discut\u00e9 de son poste avec son employeuse. Elles ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante quitterait son poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans l\u2019\u00e9quipe de soins, qui \u00e9tait un poste \u00e0 temps partiel (0,8) d\u2019une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elle accepterait un poste occasionnelNote de bas de page 1.\n[6] Le changement a permis \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de faire moins d\u2019heures de travail pour \u00eatre mieux en mesure de suivre des cours plus exigeants. Il a aussi donn\u00e9 plus de souplesse \u00e0 l\u2019employeuse pour qu\u2019elle puisse planifier les quarts de travail de l\u2019appelante en dehors de ses heures de cours.\n[7] L\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi le 17 septembre 2022.\n[8] La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante avait volontairement quitt\u00e9 (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle avait choisi de quitter) son emploi sans justification. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations.\n[9] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Si oui, je dois aussi d\u00e9cider si elle a prouv\u00e9 que quitter son emploi \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas.\n[10] Selon la Commission, l\u2019appelante a pris la d\u00e9cision personnelle de quitter son emploi \u00e0 temps plein pour retourner aux \u00e9tudes, car elle voulait changer de carri\u00e8re. Elle affirme que le passage d\u2019un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 un poste occasionnel \u00e9tait une d\u00e9cision personnelle qui ne constitue pas une justificationNote de bas de page 2.\n[11] L\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. Elle dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au ch\u00f4mage. Elle est pass\u00e9e d\u2019un poste 0,8 temps plein \u00e0 un poste occasionnel. Elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demandeNote de bas de page 3.\nQuestions pr\u00e9liminaires La question en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel [12] L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 en appel au Tribunal deux d\u00e9cisions de la Commission : celle portant sur la disponibilit\u00e9 et celle portant sur le d\u00e9part volontaire.\n[13] Un autre membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 les deux questions. La Commission a fait appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision que ce membre a rendue au sujet du d\u00e9part volontaire. La division d\u2019appel a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur la question du d\u00e9part volontaire et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour r\u00e9examen. Ainsi, la seule question que je dois trancher est celle de savoir si l\u2019appelante a quitt\u00e9 son emploi volontairement. Si la r\u00e9ponse est oui, je dois aussi voir si son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait fond\u00e9.\nQuestion en litige [14] Voici ce que je dois d\u00e9cider :\nL\u2019appelante a\u2011t-elle volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi? Si oui, \u00e9tait\u2011elle fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi?\nAnalyse L\u2019appelante a quitt\u00e9 son emploi de fa\u00e7on volontaire [15] Je juge que l\u2019appelante a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi.\n[16] Elle dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Son employeuse et elle ont eu une conversation au sujet de son emploi et de ses \u00e9tudes. Elles savaient que l\u2019appelante ne serait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 travailler au m\u00eame endroit apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu son dipl\u00f4meNote de bas de page 4. Elles ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la meilleure fa\u00e7on de l\u2019aider durant ses \u00e9tudes \u00e9tait qu\u2019elle passe d\u2019un poste \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 un poste occasionnelNote de bas de page 5. Avant que l\u2019employeuse accepte le changement, l\u2019appelante devait accepter un horaire de travail pour le temps des f\u00eates.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, le poste \u00e0 temps partiel de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par un poste occasionnel. L\u2019employeuse lui a fait parvenir une lettre confirmant que son poste \u00e0 temps partiel prenait fin le 24 septembre 2022, tout comme son assurance m\u00e9dicale et dentaire et ses autres avantages sociaux. La lettre confirmait que l\u2019appelante travaillerait encore comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e occasionnelle au sein de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de soins dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissementNote de bas de page 6.\n[18] L\u2019employeuse a dit \u00e0 la Commission que l\u2019appelante avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste pour en prendre un nouveau. Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas seulement son horaire qui avait chang\u00e9Note de bas de page 7. Selon la Commission, c\u2019est bien un d\u00e9part volontaire.\n[19] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Commission : l\u2019appelante a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\n[20] Premi\u00e8rement, je juge que remplacer un poste \u00e0 temps partiel par un poste occasionnel \u00e9tait un changement d\u2019emploi, et non pas une simple modification de l\u2019horaire. L\u2019appelante est pass\u00e9e d\u2019un poste o\u00f9 ses heures \u00e9taient garanties et o\u00f9 elle avait des avantages sociaux \u00e0 un poste sans avantages sociaux ni aucune assurance qu\u2019elle aurait des heures de travail. La lettre de l\u2019employeuse indique clairement qu\u2019elle tenait pour acquis que l\u2019appelante avait mis fin \u00e0 son poste \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[21] L\u2019appelante affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 au ch\u00f4mage. Elle est pass\u00e9e tout de suite du poste \u00e0 temps partiel au poste occasionnel. Personne ne conteste le fait qu\u2019elle travaillait toujours pour l\u2019employeuse. Cependant, il y a quand m\u00eame eu une cessation d\u2019emploi, quoique br\u00e8ve, lorsqu\u2019elle a chang\u00e9 de poste et de conditions d\u2019emploi.\n[22] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019appelante a choisi de quitter le poste \u00e0 temps partiel pour prendre le poste occasionnel.\n[23] Selon la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00ab la question de savoir si un employ\u00e9 a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi est une question simple. La question qu\u2019il faut se poser est la suivante : l\u2019employ\u00e9 avait\u2011il le choix de rester ou de quitterNote de bas de page 8? \u00bb\n[24] M\u00eame si l\u2019appelante et son employeuse ont trouv\u00e9 la solution ensemble, l\u2019appelante a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle seule avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de quitter son poste \u00e0 temps partiel et de prendre le poste occasionnel.\n[25] Comme l\u2019appelante aurait pu conserver son poste \u00e0 temps partiel, mais qu\u2019elle a plut\u00f4t choisi de le quitter pour occuper le poste occasionnel, je conclus qu\u2019elle a quitt\u00e9 son poste volontairement. Elle a quitt\u00e9 son emploi de fa\u00e7on volontaire.\nCe qu\u2019on veut dire par \u00ab justification \u00bb et \u00ab \u00eatre fond\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00bb [26] La loi pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019une personne est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations si elle quitte volontairement son emploi sans justificationNote de bas de page 9. Avoir une bonne raison de quitter un emploi ne suffit pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que le d\u00e9part est fond\u00e9 ou justifi\u00e9.\n[27] Selon la loi, une personne est fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi si son d\u00e9part est la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas. La loi pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il faut tenir compte de toutes les circonstancesNote de bas de page 10.\n[28] C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de prouver que son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait fond\u00e9Note de bas de page 11. Elle doit en faire la preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Autrement dit, elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable (il y a plus de chances) que quitter son emploi \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas. Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi, je dois examiner toutes les circonstances entourant son d\u00e9part.\nRaison pour laquelle l\u2019appelante a quitt\u00e9 son emploi [29] L\u2019appelante m\u2019a dit qu\u2019elle avait quitt\u00e9 son emploi \u00e0 temps partiel et pris le poste occasionnel en raison de ses \u00e9tudes. De plus, elle sentait qu\u2019elle avait une obligation envers son employeuse \u2013 elle ne pouvait pas prendre des cong\u00e9s de maladie pour suivre ses cours.\n[30] J\u2019admets que c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle elle a quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Rien ne m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 douter de ses propos.\nL\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e vers le programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes [31] Parfois, la Commission (ou un programme approuv\u00e9 par la Commission) dirige les gens vers un cours, un programme ou une formation. L\u2019une des circonstances dont je dois tenir compte est la question de savoir si la Commission a dirig\u00e9 l\u2019appelante vers son programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes.\n[32] L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e vers sa formation. Dans son formulaire de demande, elle a \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle avait essay\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une recommandation, mais que sa formation n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9eNote de bas de page 12.\nAssurance raisonnable d\u2019avoir un autre emploi dans un avenir imm\u00e9diat [33] Une autre circonstance dont je dois tenir compte est la question de savoir si l\u2019appelante avait l\u2019assurance raisonnable d\u2019avoir un autre emploi dans un avenir imm\u00e9diatNote de bas de page 13.\n[34] Je juge que oui. Avant de quitter son emploi \u00e0 temps partiel, elle savait qu\u2019elle occuperait un poste occasionnel et qu\u2019elle travaillerait \u00e0 temps plein pendant le temps des f\u00eates.\nQuitter son emploi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule solution raisonnable qui s\u2019offrait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante [35] Au lieu de quitter son emploi \u00e0 temps partiel, elle aurait pu le conserver. C\u2019\u00e9tait une solution raisonnable.\n[36] Voici ce qu\u2019en dit la jurisprudence :\nSi une personne quitte son emploi pour suivre un programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes vers lequel elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e, elle n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploiNote de bas de page 14. Il est l\u00e9gitime de vouloir am\u00e9liorer son sort en changeant la nature de son travail et en retournant aux \u00e9tudes, mais on ne peut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la caisse d\u2019assurance-emploi essuie le co\u00fbt de ce d\u00e9sir l\u00e9gitimeNote de bas de page 15. L\u2019assurance d\u2019un emploi qui n\u2019est pas assez r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur et qui oblige \u00e0 recourir aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi ne fonde pas les prestataires \u00e0 prendre cong\u00e9 pour retourner aux \u00e9tudes et \u00e0 en faire supporter le co\u00fbt par le syst\u00e8me d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 16.\n[37] Cette jurisprudence s\u2019applique \u00e0 la situation de l\u2019appelante et ne me permet pas de conclure que cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\n[38] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi. Elle a quitt\u00e9 son emploi parce qu\u2019elle voulait terminer ses \u00e9tudes, mais elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9e vers son programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes. Et m\u00eame si elle avait l\u2019assurance raisonnable d\u2019avoir un autre emploi, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un poste occasionnel qui, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 compter sur les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[39] Je comprends que l\u2019appelante avait de bonnes raisons de quitter son emploi pour suivre une formation. Mais c\u2019\u00e9tait un choix personnel qui ne concorde pas avec l\u2019id\u00e9e de base du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 17.\n[40] Comme quitter son emploi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la seule solution qui s\u2019offrait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante (elle aurait pu continuer \u00e0 travailler), son d\u00e9part n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9.\nConclusion [41] Je conclus que l\u2019appelante a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi sans justification. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[42] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nPour l\u2019employeuse, tous les postes de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9es aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires comptent pour 0,8 ou moins.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir les pages GD4B\u20113 et GD4B\u20114 du dossier d\u2019appel.

Le Tribunal est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelante.\n[2] L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019est pas inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Il se peut donc qu\u2019elle ait droit \u00e0 des prestations.\nAper\u00e7u [3] La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada a conclu que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi du 7 septembre 2021 au 30 juin 2022 parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler. Une partie prestataire doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler pour recevoir des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. La disponibilit\u00e9 est une exigence continue. Il faut donc que la partie prestataire soit \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi.\n[4] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler. L\u2019appelante doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler.\n[5] La Commission soutient que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tudiait \u00e0 temps plein et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 peu d\u2019efforts pour trouver un emploi.\n[6] L\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord et soutient qu\u2019elle cherchait activement un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Elle travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel et continuait \u00e0 chercher du travail. Ses \u00e9tudes ne limitaient pas sa disponibilit\u00e9.\nQuestion que je dois examiner en premier La division d\u2019appel a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019appel de l\u2019appelante \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [7] L\u2019appelante a d\u2019abord fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission selon laquelle elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal en f\u00e9vrier 2023. Elle a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal de sa disponibilit\u00e9 et de ses d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi.\n[8] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler. L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal.\n[9] La division d\u2019appel a jug\u00e9 que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait mal examin\u00e9 la preuve de l\u2019appelante concernant sa recherche d\u2019emploi et sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler. Ce faisant, elle avait commis une erreur importante.\n[10] La division d\u2019appel a ordonn\u00e9 le renvoi de l\u2019appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour une nouvelle audience. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est le r\u00e9sultat de cette audience.\nQuestion en litige [11] L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle disponible pour travailler pendant ses \u00e9tudes?\nAnalyse [12] Il y a deux articles de loi qui exigent qu\u2019une partie appelante d\u00e9montre sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler. La Commission a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait inadmissible selon ces deux articles. Elle doit donc remplir les crit\u00e8res des deux articles pour recevoir des prestations.\n[13] Premi\u00e8rement, la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi dit qu\u2019une partie prestataire doit prouver qu\u2019elle fait des \u00ab d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables \u00bb pour trouver un emploi convenableNote de bas de page 1. Le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit des crit\u00e8res qui aident \u00e0 expliquer ce qui constitue des \u00ab d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnablesNote de bas de page 2 \u00bb. Je vais examiner ces crit\u00e8res ci-dessous.\n[14] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi dit qu\u2019une personne doit prouver qu\u2019elle est \u00ab capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin \u00bb, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenableNote de bas de page 3. Selon la jurisprudence, il y a trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments que la partie prestataire doit prouver pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle est \u00ab disponible \u00bb en ce sensNote de bas de page 4. Je vais examiner ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-dessous.\n[15] La Commission a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler selon ces deux articles de loi.\n[16] De plus, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les personnes aux \u00e9tudes \u00e0 temps plein sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es ne pas \u00eatre disponibles pour travaillerNote de bas de page 5. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle la pr\u00e9somption de non-disponibilit\u00e9. Autrement dit, on peut supposer qu\u2019une personne n\u2019est pas disponible pour travailler lorsque la preuve montre qu\u2019elle \u00e9tudie \u00e0 temps plein.\n[17] Je vais d\u2019abord voir si je peux pr\u00e9sumer que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler. Ensuite, j\u2019examinerai si elle \u00e9tait disponible selon les deux articles de loi portant sur la disponibilit\u00e9.\nPr\u00e9somption que les personnes qui \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein ne sont pas disponibles pour travailler [18] La pr\u00e9somption de non-disponibilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019aux personnes aux \u00e9tudes \u00e0 temps plein. L\u2019appelante \u00e9tait \u00e9tudiante \u00e0 temps plein au secondaire, alors cette pr\u00e9somption s\u2019applique \u00e0 elle.\n[19] La pr\u00e9somption selon laquelle les personnes qui \u00e9tudient \u00e0 temps plein ne sont pas disponibles pour travailler peut \u00eatre r\u00e9fut\u00e9e (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019on peut montrer qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019applique pas). Si la pr\u00e9somption est r\u00e9fut\u00e9e, elle ne s\u2019applique pas.\n[20] L\u2019appelante peut r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption de deux fa\u00e7ons. Elle peut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein tout en \u00e9tudiantNote de bas de page 6. Elle peut aussi d\u00e9montrer que des circonstances exceptionnelles s\u2019appliquent dans son casNote de bas de page 7.\n[21] L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 pendant ses \u00e9tudes. Elle travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel dans un d\u00e9panneur depuis mars 2021. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 occuper cet emploi tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire suivante.\n[22] L\u2019appelante avait un horaire scolaire flexible. Son cours \u00e9tait disponible en ligne en raison des mesures li\u00e9es \u00e0 la COVID-19. Sa pr\u00e9sence au cours n\u2019\u00e9tait pas obligatoire. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle pouvait visionner les enregistrements de cours \u00e0 tout moment et effectuer ses travaux scolaires \u00e0 son rythme.\n[23] L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que des circonstances exceptionnelles s\u2019appliquent dans son cas. Premi\u00e8rement, elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler tout en \u00e9tudiant \u00e0 temps plein. Deuxi\u00e8mement, elle pouvait visionner ses enregistrements de cours et faire ses travaux scolaires \u00e0 tout moment. Sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 conserver son emploi tout en poursuivant ses \u00e9tudes et son horaire de cours flexible suffisent \u00e0 r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption de non\u2011disponibilit\u00e9.\n[24] Le fait de r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption signifie seulement qu\u2019on ne pr\u00e9sume pas que l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas disponible. Je dois quand m\u00eame examiner les deux articles de loi applicables et d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante est r\u00e9ellement disponible.\nD\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi [25] Le premier article de loi que je vais examiner pr\u00e9voit que les parties appelantes doivent prouver qu\u2019elles ont fait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploiNote de bas de page 8.\n[26] La loi \u00e9nonce les crit\u00e8res dont je dois tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si les d\u00e9marches de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient habituelles et raisonnablesNote de bas de page 9. Je dois v\u00e9rifier si ses d\u00e9marches \u00e9taient soutenues et si elles visaient \u00e0 trouver un emploi convenable. Autrement dit, l\u2019appelante doit avoir continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un emploi convenable.\n[27] Je dois aussi \u00e9valuer les d\u00e9marches que l\u2019appelante a faites pour se trouver un emploi. Le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi dresse la liste de neuf activit\u00e9s de recherche d\u2019emploi dont je dois tenir compte. En voici quelques exemplesNote de bas de page 10 :\n\u00e9valuer les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi; faire du r\u00e9seautage; communiquer avec d\u2019\u00e9ventuels employeurs.\n[28] La Commission affirme que l\u2019appelante n\u2019en a pas fait assez pour tenter de trouver un emploi.\n[29] L\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. Elle cherchait activement du travail. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle cherchait des emplois pour lesquels elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle postulait principalement dans des restaurants rapides et des magasins de d\u00e9tail.\n[30] Elle a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un curriculum vitae et est all\u00e9e le d\u00e9poser chez six employeurs qui, \u00e0 sa connaissance, \u00e9taient ouverts et susceptibles d\u2019embaucher. Sa m\u00e8re et elle ont v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 tous les jours les nouvelles offres d\u2019emploi en ligne. Elle a fait du r\u00e9seautage avec des amis et des membres de sa famille pour s\u2019informer sur des emplois potentiels.\n[31] La Commission a fait valoir que les d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient insuffisantes parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a postul\u00e9 qu\u2019aupr\u00e8s de six employeurs pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[32] Je reconnais que le fait de postuler \u00e0 six emplois sur une p\u00e9riode de dix mois peut sembler \u00eatre une recherche d\u2019emploi limit\u00e9e. Cependant, je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019appelante a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 des emplois pendant une p\u00e9riode de restrictions extraordinaires impos\u00e9es aux entreprises.\n[33] La m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait peu d\u2019entreprises et que de nombreux d\u2019employeurs \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9s ou n\u2019embauchaient pas pendant cette p\u00e9riode en raison des restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la COVID-19. Elle a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait toujours \u00e9tudiante au secondaire et qu\u2019elle avait peu de qualifications pour occuper des emplois en dehors des secteurs de la restauration et de la vente de d\u00e9tail. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante postulait \u00e0 tous les emplois qu\u2019elle pouvait. De plus, l\u2019appelante retournait aussi voir chacun des employeurs aupr\u00e8s desquels elle avait postul\u00e9 et leur demandait s\u2019il y avait de nouveaux postes \u00e0 pourvoir.\n[34] Le t\u00e9moignage de la m\u00e8re de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait cr\u00e9dible. Elle a donn\u00e9 un compte rendu d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante et de sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour travailler. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9pondre aux questions sur les d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelante de fa\u00e7on ouverte et directe.\n[35] J\u2019accorde de l\u2019importance aux t\u00e9moignages de l\u2019appelante et de sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019audience concernant les d\u00e9marches de recherche d\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle a faites et les possibilit\u00e9s limit\u00e9es d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[36] J\u2019estime que l\u2019appelante a fait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi. Elle a fait un certain nombre de d\u00e9marches et a cherch\u00e9 un emploi convenable en postulant \u00e0 des emplois pour lesquels elle \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e. La preuve montre que ses d\u00e9marches ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenues tout au long de la p\u00e9riode en question.\nCapable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin [37] Je dois aussi v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenableNote de bas de page 11. La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments que je dois prendre en compte pour trancher cette question. L\u2019appelante doit prouver les trois choses suivantesNote de bas de page 12 :\na) qu\u2019elle voulait retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable serait offert; b) qu\u2019elle a fait des efforts pour trouver un emploi convenable; c) qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de conditions personnelles qui pouvaient limiter ind\u00fbment (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire trop) ses chances de retourner travailler.\n[38] Lorsque j\u2019examine chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je dois prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019attitude et la conduite de l\u2019appelanteNote de bas de page 13.\nD\u00e9sir de retourner travailler [39] L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable serait offert.\n[40] Elle cherchait activement du travail. Elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec des employeurs potentiels et a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 des emplois. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que travailler \u00e9tait sa priorit\u00e9. Ainsi, m\u00eame si elle travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel, elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un autre emploi \u00e0 temps partiel ou \u00e0 temps plein.\n[41] Les d\u00e9marches de l\u2019appelante pour se trouver du travail d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019elle voulait retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable serait offert.\nEfforts pour trouver un emploi convenable [42] L\u2019appelante a fait assez d\u2019efforts pour trouver un emploi convenable.\n[43] Pour tirer une conclusion sur ce deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la liste des activit\u00e9s de recherche d\u2019emploi mentionn\u00e9e plus haut. Cette liste me sert seulement de r\u00e9f\u00e9renceNote de bas de page 14.\n[44] Pour trouver un nouvel emploi, l\u2019appelante a notamment r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un curriculum vitae, \u00e9valu\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi, fait du r\u00e9seautage, communiqu\u00e9 avec des employeurs potentiels et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes d\u2019emploi. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t lorsque j\u2019ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 si l\u2019appelante avait fait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi.\n[45] Je crois que l\u2019appelante cherchait du travail. Elle a fait des d\u00e9marches raisonnables pour trouver un emploi convenable. Elle a satisfait \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\nLimitation indue des chances de retourner travailler [46] L\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de conditions personnelles qui pouvaient limiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler.\n[47] La Commission affirme que les \u00e9tudes de l\u2019appelante \u00e9taient une condition personnelle qui limitait ses chances de trouver du travail.\n[48] Lors de sa premi\u00e8re demande de prestations, l\u2019appelante a rempli un questionnaire de formation. Le questionnaire lui demandait ce qu\u2019elle ferait si elle trouvait un emploi \u00e0 temps plein qui entrait en conflit avec ses \u00e9tudes. L\u2019appelante a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle les abandonnerait pour accepter l\u2019emploi.\n[49] L\u2019appelante a r\u00e9pondu la m\u00eame chose lorsque la Commission lui a pos\u00e9 cette question. Elle a dit \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal que travailler \u00e9tait sa priorit\u00e9. Elle a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait accumul\u00e9 plus de 200 absence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle avait choisi de travailler plut\u00f4t que de suivre son cours. Lorsqu\u2019on lui avait propos\u00e9 des quarts de travail qui entraient en conflit avec ses \u00e9tudes, elle avait choisi de les faire.\n[50] De plus, l\u2019appelante a expliqu\u00e9 que ses \u00e9tudes \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s flexibles et qu\u2019elles ne l\u2019auraient pas emp\u00each\u00e9e d\u2019accepter un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Elle pouvait visionner son cours en ligne et faire ses travaux scolaires \u00e0 tout moment.\n[51] Je crois l\u2019appelante. Elle a livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage cr\u00e9dible sur la nature de son cours et sur sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 concilier un travail \u00e0 temps plein et ses \u00e9tudes. Son t\u00e9moignage est appuy\u00e9 par le fait qu\u2019elle a postul\u00e9 \u00e0 des emplois \u00e0 temps plein et \u00e0 temps partiel pendant ses \u00e9tudes.\n[52] Pour ces raisons, je conclus que les \u00e9tudes de l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9taient pas une condition personnelle qui limitait ind\u00fbment ses chances de trouver un emploi.\nL\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle donc capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin? [53] Selon mes conclusions sur les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je juge que l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 cette fin, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenable.\nConclusion [54] L\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler au sens de la loi. Pour cette raison, je conclus qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations. Il est donc possible qu\u2019elle ait droit \u00e0 des prestations.\n[55] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir l\u2019article 50(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir l\u2019article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Faucher c Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration du Canada, A-56-96 et A-57-96.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Cyrenne, 2010 CAF 349.\nNote de bas de page 6\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Rideout, 2004 CAF 304.\nNote de bas de page 7\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Cyrenne, 2010 CAF 349.\nNote de bas de page 8\nVoir l\u2019article 50(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 9\nVoir l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 10\nVoir l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 11\nVoir l\u2019article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 12\nCes trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont mentionn\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Faucher c Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration du Canada, A-56-96 et A-57-96.

Le Tribunal est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelant.\n[2] Le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice (ni inadmissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice) des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi.\nAper\u00e7u [3] Le pr\u00e9sent appel porte sur la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi sans justification.\n[4] L\u2019appelant travaillait comme ouvrier agricole au Canada dans le cadre du programme des travailleurs \u00e9trangers. De 2019 \u00e0 2022, il a effectu\u00e9 un travail agricole saisonnier d\u2019avril \u00e0 novembre, passant d\u2019une ferme \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Il est retourn\u00e9 dans son pays d\u2019origine pendant les mois o\u00f9 il ne travaillait pas.\n[5] La saison de 2022 a d\u00e9but\u00e9 comme les autres. En avril 2022, il vivait au Canada dans un pavillon-dortoir \u00e0 la ferme de son employeur, mais il n\u2019avait pas encore commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler. En parlant au personnel de Service Canada, il a appris qu\u2019il pouvait demander des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Il a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande et a \u00e9tabli une p\u00e9riode de prestations \u00e0 compter du 24 avril 2022. Il a dit \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues qu\u2019ils pouvaient aussi pr\u00e9senter une demande.\n[6] L\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle demande de prestations (demande renouvel\u00e9e) le 4 juillet 2022, apr\u00e8s la fin de son emploi le 28 juin 2022.\n[7] Au d\u00e9part, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant pouvait recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Elle a chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis apr\u00e8s que l\u2019employeur lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas verser de prestations \u00e0 l\u2019appelant parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi.\n[8] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal a convenu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi. L\u2019appelant a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en appel devant la division d\u2019appel. Celle-ci a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait commis des erreurs de droit et lui a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire pour r\u00e9examen.\n[9] Je dois donc d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019il \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Le fait d\u2019\u00eatre fond\u00e9 signifie que le d\u00e9part \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas.\nQuestions en litige [10] Je dois r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\na) L\u2019appelant a-t-il quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi? b) Si oui, \u00e9tait-il fond\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire? Autrement dit, son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait-il la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas? c) S\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi, l\u2019a-t-il fait dans les trois semaines suivant la date o\u00f9 son emploi devait prendre fin?\nAnalyse L\u2019appelant a-t-il quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi? [11] Non. Je conclus que l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de travailler quand son emploi a pris fin.\nCe que signifie quitter volontairement un emploi [12] La loi pr\u00e9voit que lorsque je d\u00e9cide si l\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi, je dois \u00e9valuer s\u2019il avait le choix de rester ou de le quitterNote de bas de page 1. S\u2019il avait le choix de rester et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas fait, il a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi.\n[13] La Commission doit prouver qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que l\u2019appelant a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi [14] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le choix de rester. Son emploi a pris fin le 28 juin 2022, lorsque l\u2019employeur a retir\u00e9 son quart de travail. Comme je l\u2019explique ci-dessous, j\u2019ai tenu compte du contrat, du travail de l\u2019appelant ainsi que des d\u00e9clarations et des actions de l\u2019appelant et de l\u2019employeur.\nLe contrat [15] Le contrat de l\u2019appelant a pris fin le 11 juillet 2022. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que l\u2019employeur avait du travail pour l\u2019appelant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date ni que son emploi n\u2019a pas pris fin le 28 juin 2022. En effet, l\u2019employeur a seulement pay\u00e9 les heures que l\u2019appelant a travaill\u00e9es. Ainsi, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait sous contrat lorsqu\u2019il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la ferme pour la premi\u00e8re fois en avril 2022, mais comme il y avait peu de travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me semaine de mai, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9Note de bas de page 2.\nCe que l\u2019appelant a fait pour l\u2019employeur [16] Le travail de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait de surveiller la balance dans la grange. C\u2019est un travail qui se fait \u00e0 deux et il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule balance. Pendant la haute saison, il y avait deux quarts de travail, donc quatre personnes faisaient ce travail particulier. Apr\u00e8s le 28 juin 2022, l\u2019employeur n\u2019a inscrit qu\u2019un seul quart de travail \u00e0 l\u2019horaire, soit celui que l\u2019appelant ne travaillait pas.\n[17] Quand l\u2019employeur a r\u00e9duit le poste de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 un quart de travail par jour, l\u2019appelant a dit qu\u2019il savait que son emploi \u00e9tait termin\u00e9. Il a donc cess\u00e9 de se rendre \u00e0 la grange pour travailler. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 du changement par un autre employ\u00e9.\nCe qui est arriv\u00e9 selon eux [18] L\u2019appelant affirme que l\u2019employeur lui a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. L\u2019employeur \u00e9tait f\u00e2ch\u00e9 contre l\u2019appelant parce qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 des prestations et a dit \u00e0 d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient admissibles.\n[19] L\u2019appelant affirme que l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas aim\u00e9 que Service Canada contacte son bureau et pose des questions. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 que m\u00eame si l\u2019employeur paie toutes les heures travaill\u00e9es, il ne les paie pas toujours pour la bonne p\u00e9riode de paie. L\u2019employeur retient la paie pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires travaill\u00e9es pendant la haute saison et la verse plus tard vers la fin de la saison, lorsque c\u2019est moins occup\u00e9Note de bas de page 3. Pour cette raison, l\u2019employeur ne voulait pas que Service Canada examine ses activit\u00e9s.\n[20] L\u2019appelant affirme que m\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019entendait bien avec l\u2019employeur au cours des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, apr\u00e8s que ce dernier a appris qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 des prestations et expliqu\u00e9 aux autres comment le faire, l\u2019employeur a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appeler le [traduction] \u00ab fut\u00e9 \u00bb. L\u2019employeur parlait \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes l\u00e0 o\u00f9 l\u2019appelant pouvait l\u2019entendre et disait des choses comme [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019appelant ne travaillera plus ici \u00bb et qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tait impatient que l\u2019appelant cesse de travailler \u00bbNote de bas de page 4. L\u2019appelant affirme que lorsque l\u2019employeur entrait dans la grange o\u00f9 il travaillait, il le saluait, mais l\u2019employeur ne lui r\u00e9pondait pas. Il affirme que l\u2019employeur lui a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait libre d\u2019arr\u00eater de travailler n\u2019importe quand et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019aiderait pas \u00e0 trouver un autre emploi agricole.\n[21] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019autour du 24 juin 2022, l\u2019employeur a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre employ\u00e9 d\u2019aller voir l\u2019appelant travailler afin qu\u2019il puisse apprendre ce travail pour la prochaine saison. L\u2019autre employ\u00e9 a dit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant que l\u2019employeur le lib\u00e9rait de ses fonctions (autrement dit, il l\u2019a lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de son contrat).\n[22] \u00c0 la connaissance de l\u2019appelant, aucun de ses coll\u00e8gues ayant demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 en 2023.\n[23] L\u2019employeur a ni\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission avoir dit \u00e0 l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il ne serait pas r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante.\n[24] L\u2019employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que le quart de soir de l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9 le 28 juin 2022 parce que la saison s\u2019achevait. Cependant, il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que l\u2019appelant se pr\u00e9sente pour le quart de 6 hNote de bas de page 5. L\u2019employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de travailler parce qu\u2019il n\u2019en avait plus l\u2019envieNote de bas de page 6. L\u2019employeur affirme que quelques jours ont pass\u00e9 sans que personne s\u2019aper\u00e7oive que l\u2019appelant ne travaillait plusNote de bas de page 7.\n[25] J\u2019estime que les d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019employeur ne sont ni fiables ni cr\u00e9dibles.\n[26] Premi\u00e8rement, le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelant pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par l\u2019employeur ne refl\u00e8te pas ce que celui-ci a dit \u00e0 la Commission. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas eu beaucoup de travail avant le 9 mai 2022. Cependant, son relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi indique qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 plus d\u2019heures au cours des deux premi\u00e8res p\u00e9riodes de paie \u00e0 partir du 22 avril 2022 qu\u2019au cours des semaines 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 et 10Note de bas de page 8. Les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence fournies par l\u2019employeur laissent croire que l\u2019appelant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler seulement le 9 mai 2022Note de bas de page 9. Si c\u2019\u00e9tait vrai, l\u2019appelant aurait travaill\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le 28 juin 2022 selon le nombre de p\u00e9riodes de paie sur le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, ce qui n\u2019est pas arriv\u00e9. Ainsi, les d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019employeur et son relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi ne peuvent pas \u00eatre vrais tous les deux. C\u2019est la principale raison pour laquelle je juge que les d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019employeur ne sont pas fiables.\n[27] Deuxi\u00e8mement, je ne crois pas que l\u2019appelant aurait pu s\u2019absenter du travail sans que l\u2019employeur s\u2019en aper\u00e7oive, comme il le pr\u00e9tend. Voici pourquoi :\nIl n\u2019est pas raisonnable de penser que l\u2019absence de la moiti\u00e9 d\u2019une \u00e9quipe de deux personnes au travail passerait inaper\u00e7ue pendant une heure, encore moins pendant des jours comme l\u2019employeur le pr\u00e9tend. L\u2019appelant travaillait dans la grange et non dans le champ, alors s\u2019il devait travailler et ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, rien n\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pes\u00e9 et entrepos\u00e9. Comme je l\u2019ai dit, cela n\u2019aurait pas pu passer inaper\u00e7u pendant des jours. Si l\u2019employeur avait pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019appelant travaille, son superviseur aurait pris quelques minutes pour marcher de la grange \u00e0 son pavillon-dortoir et lui aurait demand\u00e9 pourquoi il ne travaillait pas. Le superviseur de l\u2019appelant habitait dans un pavillon-dortoir \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de celui de l\u2019appelant et ils \u00e9taient pr\u00e8s de la grange. Donc, le fait que l\u2019employeur ne savait pas que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au travail n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible. M\u00eame si l\u2019employeur avait pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019appelant travaille dans le champ apr\u00e8s le 28 juin 2022, il est toujours peu probable que son absence soit pass\u00e9e inaper\u00e7ue pendant des jours. Son superviseur aurait tout au moins remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait encore au pavillon-dortoir et qu\u2019il ne travaillait pas.\n[28] J\u2019estime que l\u2019employeur a attendu quelques jours avant de signaler l\u2019absence de l\u2019appelant dans l\u2019espoir qu\u2019il ne soit pas admissible aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Cette fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir correspond \u00e0 l\u2019animosit\u00e9 qu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019appelant apr\u00e8s avoir appris que celui-ci avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations. Le fait que l\u2019employeur a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision de verser des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 l\u2019appelant d\u00e9montre aussi qu\u2019il \u00e9tait contre le fait que l\u2019appelant en re\u00e7oive.\n[29] Lorsque l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de renouvellement, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir cess\u00e9 de travailler en raison d\u2019un manque de travail. J\u2019estime que cela d\u00e9montre que l\u2019appelant croyait que son emploi avait tout simplement pris fin jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Commission commence \u00e0 examiner les raisons de son d\u00e9part.\n[30] La Commission affirme que l\u2019appelant a admis \u00e0 l\u2019agente de liaison jama\u00efcaine qu\u2019il savait qu\u2019il devait travailler, mais qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter parce qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 commencer un autre emploiNote de bas de page 10. L\u2019appelant le nie. Il dit qu\u2019il a convenu avoir rompu le contrat parce qu\u2019il voulait simplement en finir.\n[31] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re la d\u00e9claration initiale de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la Commission, selon laquelle il a cess\u00e9 de travailler en raison d\u2019un manque de travail, \u00e0 ce que la Commission affirme \u00eatre la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019agente de liaison jama\u00efcaine.\n[32] La d\u00e9claration originale de l\u2019appelant \u00e0 la Commission concorde avec son t\u00e9moignage.\n[33] Dans ces circonstances, je juge peu probable que l\u2019appelant ait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment cess\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter pour un travail \u00e0 horaire fixe. Il d\u00e9pendait de l\u2019employeur pour le conduire chez son prochain employeur, pour le transport vers l\u2019\u00e9picerie et pour son logement, qui \u00e9tait sur le lieu de travail.\n[34] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, l\u2019explication de l\u2019appelant sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 est plus probable que la version de l\u2019employeur.\n[35] Je conclus donc que l\u2019emploi de l\u2019appelant a pris fin le 28 juin 2022. Comme l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas le choix de continuer \u00e0 travailler, il n\u2019a pas quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[36] Cela dit, je vais quand m\u00eame v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\nL\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi? Ce que signifie \u00eatre fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi [37] La loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une personne est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations si elle quitte volontairement son emploi sans justificationNote de bas de page 11. Il ne lui suffit pas d\u2019avoir une bonne raison de quitter un emploi pour prouver qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire.\n[38] La loi explique ce que signifie \u00ab \u00eatre fond\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00bb. Selon la loi, une personne est fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter son emploi si son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas. Elle dit qu\u2019il faut tenir compte de toutes les circonstancesNote de bas de page 12.\n[39] C\u2019est \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de prouver qu\u2019il \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi. Il doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnableNote de bas de page 13.\n[40] Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi, je dois examiner toutes les circonstances entourant son d\u00e9part. La loi \u00e9nonce certaines circonstances que je dois examinerNote de bas de page 14.\n[41] Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 quelles circonstances s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, je dois examiner s\u2019il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que son d\u00e9part \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0Note de bas de page 15.\nCe qu\u2019il est aussi arriv\u00e9 [42] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019appelant affirme que depuis que l\u2019employeur a appris qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi et expliqu\u00e9 aux autres comment le faire, l\u2019employeur se comportait diff\u00e9remment avec lui. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019employeur a :\nignor\u00e9 l\u2019appelant quand il le saluait; dit devant les autres que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait un fut\u00e9, qu\u2019il n\u2019allait pas le r\u00e9embaucher et qu\u2019il serait heureux quand l\u2019appelant aurait termin\u00e9.\n[43] L\u2019employeur a appel\u00e9 le bureau de liaison jama\u00efcain et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait rompu son contrat.\n[44] L\u2019employeur a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision de verser des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 l\u2019appelant. Dans sa demande de r\u00e9vision, l\u2019employeur a pr\u00e9tendu que l\u2019appelant restait en Ontario ill\u00e9galementNote de bas de page 16.\n[45] L\u2019appelant affirme que lorsqu\u2019il a parl\u00e9 au bureau de liaison jama\u00efcain, il a convenu qu\u2019il avait rompu le contrat parce que le bureau prend toujours le parti de l\u2019employeurNote de bas de page 17. Il affirme que le fait que l\u2019agente ne l\u2019a pas rappel\u00e9, mais qu\u2019elle a rapidement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019employeur en est la preuveNote de bas de page 18. Il dit que la seule chose que l\u2019agente de liaison voulait lui demander \u00e9tait quand il voulait quitter le Canada.\n[46] L\u2019appelant croit que l\u2019employeur s\u2019est m\u00eal\u00e9 de son prochain emploi agricole.\n[47] L\u2019employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il \u00e9tait contrari\u00e9 du fait que l\u2019appelant ait demand\u00e9 des lettres \u00e0 son personnel pour ses prestations et qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9vitait. Il a ni\u00e9 avoir dit que l\u2019appelant ne serait pas r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 et lui en vouloir pour sa demande de prestationsNote de bas de page 19.\nLes circonstances particuli\u00e8res dont je dois tenir compte [48] Selon la preuve au dossier, je dois examiner certaines des circonstances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, y compris la question de savoir s\u2019il y a eu des relations conflictuelles et du harc\u00e8lementNote de bas de page 20.\n[49] Premi\u00e8rement, je conclus qu\u2019il y avait une relation conflictuelle avec un superviseur dont l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le principal responsableNote de bas de page 21.\n[50] J\u2019accepte ce que l\u2019appelant m\u2019a dit au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019employeur l\u2019a trait\u00e9. Comme expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, les d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019employeur ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles. Je crois que le mauvais traitement de l\u2019employeur envers l\u2019appelant visait \u00e0 dissuader les autres de demander des prestations que l\u2019employeur croit qu\u2019ils ne m\u00e9ritent pas. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve convaincante que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait responsable de la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019employeur l\u2019a trait\u00e9.\n[51] Deuxi\u00e8mement, j\u2019estime que les actions de l\u2019employeur constituent \u00e9galement du harc\u00e8lement. Son comportement verbal visait \u00e0 humilier l\u2019appelant. Celui-ci a persist\u00e9 du moment o\u00f9 l\u2019employeur a appris que l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il cesse de travailler.\n[52] Troisi\u00e8mement, je me suis \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 si les pratiques de l\u2019employeur pouvaient \u00eatre contraires \u00e0 la loiNote de bas de page 22. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas pay\u00e9 l\u2019appelant pour son travail au cours des bonnes p\u00e9riodes de paie et l\u2019appelant travaillait normalement sept jours par semaineNote de bas de page 23. Mais l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fourni suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9montrer que les pratiques de l\u2019employeur sont contraires \u00e0 la loi et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quelle loi elles enfreignent.\n[53] Enfin, la Commission affirme que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas l\u2019assurance raisonnable d\u2019un autre emploi dans un avenir imm\u00e9diatNote de bas de page 24. L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ce fait et je ne vois aucune preuve du contraire.\nL\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucune autre solution raisonnable [54] Je dois maintenant v\u00e9rifier si le d\u00e9part de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas.\n[55] Je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de partir en raison du traitement que l\u2019employeur lui a fait subir. Il n\u2019aurait pas pu continuer \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019employeur \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la persistance des commentaires et du traitement. Le mauvais traitement nuisait \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9 mentale et \u00e9tait exacerb\u00e9 par le fait que l\u2019appelant vivait sur son lieu de travail. Il n\u2019a pas eu de r\u00e9pit parce qu\u2019il vivait avec ceux qui entendaient les paroles de l\u2019employeur et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moins du traitement hostile et harcelant qu\u2019il a subi. Autrement dit, le fait de rester jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il ait un autre emploi n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une solution raisonnable.\n[56] La Commission affirme que l\u2019appelant aurait pu signaler la situation au bureau de liaison jama\u00efcainNote de bas de page 25.\n[57] Parler au bureau de liaison jama\u00efcain n\u2019aurait pas aid\u00e9 l\u2019appelant. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant selon lequel malgr\u00e9 les frais qu\u2019il a pay\u00e9s au bureau, celui-ci prend souvent le parti de l\u2019employeur parce que s\u2019il ne le faisait pas, l\u2019employeur ferait appel \u00e0 une autre agence pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 trouver des travailleurs. L\u2019agente ne le rappelait pas et lorsqu\u2019elle lui a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019employeur, elle ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 sa version des faits. Elle ne lui a pas permis d\u2019expliquer que cette photo de lui aux chutes Niagara qu\u2019elle croyait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 prise pendant qu\u2019il devait travailler l\u2019avait plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il est donc probable que l\u2019agente ne s\u2019int\u00e9ressait pas \u00e0 ce que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e0 dire avant la fin de son emploi.\n[58] La Commission affirme que puisque l\u2019agente de liaison jama\u00efcaine ne le rappelait pas, l\u2019appelant aurait pu se rendre au bureau de liaison en personne. Ce n\u2019est pas une solution raisonnable parce que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait aucun moyen r\u00e9aliste de s\u2019y rendre. L\u2019appelant vivait et travaillait \u00e0 la campagne, \u00e0 environ deux heures de voiture du bureau. \u00c0 la connaissance de l\u2019appelant, il n\u2019y avait pas de transport en commun \u00e0 cet endroit. Il d\u00e9pendait de son employeur pour tous ses besoins de transport, y compris ses courses et son d\u00e9placement vers son prochain employeur. De plus, il travaillait sept jours par semaine la majorit\u00e9 du temps. L\u2019id\u00e9e qu\u2019il aurait pu se rendre au bureau est irr\u00e9aliste, alors ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une solution raisonnable.\n[59] Comme l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autre solution raisonnable, il \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\nQuitter un emploi trois semaines avant sa fin [60] La division d\u2019appel voulait que je v\u00e9rifie si l\u2019appelant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inadmissible aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que son contrat expire.\n[61] Malgr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision, la Commission croit maintenant que l\u2019appelant ne devrait pas \u00eatre \u00ab exclu \u00bb du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, mais qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre \u00ab inadmissible \u00bb seulement du 28 juin au 11 juillet 2022.\n[62] En effet, la Loi pr\u00e9voit que les prestataires qui quittent volontairement leur emploi sans justification dans les trois semaines pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la fin de leur p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi ne sont pas admissibles au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, mais ce seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin pr\u00e9vue de leur emploiNote de bas de page 26.\n[63] Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 plus haut, l\u2019appelant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 pris fin.\n[64] Cependant, s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9 \u00e0 le quitter, je suis d\u2019accord avec la Commission pour dire que son emploi aurait autrement pris fin le 11 juillet 2022, soit dans les trois semaines suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle il a cess\u00e9 de travailler.

M., la permission de faire appel. L\u2019appel ne se poursuivra pas. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La requ\u00e9rante a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en f\u00e9vrier 2022. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande apr\u00e8s un premier examen et apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision. La requ\u00e9rante a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du ministre en appel devant le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\n[3] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante. En effet, elle a conclu que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1996 ou en date du 31 octobre 1997.\nQuestions en litige [4] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) Est-il d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur du fait qu'elle n'a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable? b) Est-il d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faits? c) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui justifieraient d\u2019accorder la permission de faire appel?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [5] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 1.\n[6] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle pr\u00e9sente dans sa demande des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 2.\n[7] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019argument d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui justifieraient de lui accorder la permission de faire appel, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019ait pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable [8] La requ\u00e9rante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment pr\u00eate pour l\u2019audience devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019il y a bien d\u2019autres choses qu\u2019elle aurait pu dire durant l\u2019audienceNote de bas de page 3.\n[9] Ce que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 suppose peut varier selon les circonstancesNote de bas de page 4. La question de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessite essentiellement que les personnes touch\u00e9es par le processus disposent d'une chance r\u00e9elle de faire valoir leur position pleinement et \u00e9quitablement, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances.\n[10] Le devoir d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement consiste \u00e0 permettre aux gens d\u2019\u00eatre entendus. Il faut leur donner la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des arguments relativement \u00e0 chaque fait ou facteur susceptible d\u2019avoir une incidence sur la d\u00e9cisionNote de bas de page 5.\n[11] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne lui ait pas offert une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commenc\u00e9 l\u2019audience en lui expliquant le crit\u00e8re juridique qu\u2019elle devait remplir. La requ\u00e9rante a ensuite livr\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignageNote de bas de page 6. Elle n\u2019a pas fait allusion \u00e0 son manque de pr\u00e9paration durant l\u2019audience, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inciter la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 proc\u00e9der diff\u00e9remment.\n[12] Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir commis une relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve montrant une telle iniquit\u00e9. De plus, mon examen du dossier ne me laisse pas croire que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son devoir de mener une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faits [13] La requ\u00e9rante soutient qu\u2019elle a des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 (deux types d\u2019arthrite) qui l\u2019emp\u00eachent de travailler. Compte tenu de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, elle affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a n\u00e9cessairement commis une erreur en concluant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9Note de bas de page 7.\n[14] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faits. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas simplement question de savoir si la requ\u00e9rante avait des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 l\u2019emp\u00eachant de travailler dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat. La question que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait examiner \u00e9tait plus pointue.\n[15] En effet, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 que la requ\u00e9rante devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada est apparue au cours de sa p\u00e9riode de protection et a perdur\u00e9 par la suiteNote de bas de page 8. La p\u00e9riode de protection de la requ\u00e9rante est \u00e9tablie en fonction des cotisations qu\u2019elle a vers\u00e9es au R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[16] Compte tenu de ses cotisations, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 que sa p\u00e9riode de protection avait pris fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 1996. Elle avait vers\u00e9 d\u2019autres cotisations au programme, mais inf\u00e9rieures au minimum requis. Ces cotisations lui permettaient n\u00e9anmoins de prolonger sa protection, lui donnant jusqu\u2019au 31 octobre 1997 pour d\u00e9montrer une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e.\n[17] Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en appliquant le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada aux faits concernant les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de la requ\u00e9rante.\n[18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a dit clairement que la preuve de la requ\u00e9rante contenait de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments montrant des d\u00e9ficiences importantes en date de l\u2019audienceNote de bas de page 9. Cependant, une preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9tait requise pour \u00e9tayer ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 durant sa p\u00e9riode de protectionNote de bas de page 10. Les documents portant sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de 2014, soit de nombreuses ann\u00e9es plus tard, n\u2019ont pas permis \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\nLa requ\u00e9rante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais ceux-ci ne justifient pas la permission de faire appel [19] La requ\u00e9rante a fourni de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le document soumis est un rapport d\u2019imagerie diagnostique de sa colonne vert\u00e9brale datant du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2024Note de bas de page 11.\n[20] Ce rapport n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 la question de savoir si la requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e en date du 31 d\u00e9cembre 1996 ou du 31 octobre 1997. Le rapport d\u00e9crit les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019imagerie du 6 f\u00e9vrier 2024 par rapport \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents examens pass\u00e9s, dont celui du 17 ao\u00fbt 2021.\n[21] Ce rapport n\u2019apporte aucune pr\u00e9cision sur la p\u00e9riode que la division d\u2019appel doit examiner. En tant que preuve, il ne peut \u00eatre le fondement pour accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.\n[22] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossierNote de bas de page 12. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la preuve dans cet appel. La requ\u00e9rante a de nombreux probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux diagnostiqu\u00e9s qui nuisent maintenant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler. L\u2019issue de cet appel est ainsi malheureuse. Toutefois, je ne peux modifier la fa\u00e7on dont s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante les dispositions du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada relatives aux cotisations et aux p\u00e9riodes de protection.\nConclusion [23] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le 23 avril 2021, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) a rendu une d\u00e9cision par laquelle elle d\u00e9clare ne pas pouvoir verser de prestation \u00e0 la demanderesse (prestataire) depuis le d\u00e9but de sa p\u00e9riode de prestation.\n[3] Le 26 juillet 2023, la prestataire a rempli une demande de r\u00e9vision. La Commission a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une intention constante de contester la d\u00e9cision initiale. Elle a refus\u00e9 de prolonger le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pour demander la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision du 23 avril 2021. La prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de mani\u00e8re judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de prolonger le d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pour demander une r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision initiale. Elle ne pouvait donc intervenir.\n[5] La prestataire demande maintenant \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas rest\u00e9e les bras crois\u00e9s. Elle a fait des appels, et cherchait des adresses o\u00f9 elle pouvait se rendre. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler afin de s\u2019occuper de son fils qui \u00e9tait malade et parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019aller au service de garde. La prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en droit de recevoir des prestations pendant cette p\u00e9riode difficile.\nQuestion en litige [6] La loi sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.Note de bas page 1 Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[7] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que la prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel elle devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, la prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais elle doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, elle doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[8] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par la prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas la permission de faire appel \u00e0 la prestataire [9] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas rest\u00e9e les bras crois\u00e9s. Elle a fait des appels, et cherchait des adresses o\u00f9 elle pouvait se rendre pour contester la d\u00e9cision initiale.\n[10] La prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler afin de s\u2019occuper de son fils qui \u00e9tait malade et parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas le droit d\u2019aller au service de garde. La prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en droit de recevoir des prestations pendant cette p\u00e9riode difficile.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y avait lieu pour le Tribunal d\u2019intervenir \u00e0 la suite du refus de la Commission de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de trente jours pr\u00e9vus pour pr\u00e9senter une demande de r\u00e9vision.\n[12] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le 23 avril 2021, la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision par laquelle elle d\u00e9clare ne pas pouvoir verser de prestation \u00e0 la prestataire depuis le d\u00e9but de sa p\u00e9riode de prestation. Une demande de r\u00e9vision a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la prestataire que le 26 juillet 2023.\n[13] La Commission a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas de motif raisonnable pour expliquer son retard de plus de deux ans et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une intention constante de demander une r\u00e9vision.\n[14] Devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la prestataire a justifi\u00e9 son retard par le fait qu\u2019elle ne savait tout simplement pas comment en appeler de cette d\u00e9cision. Elle affirme avoir tent\u00e9 de s\u2019informer, mais elle a dit qu\u2019on ne l\u2019aidait pas vraiment ou qu\u2019on lui disait qu\u2019il fallait attendre. Elle a dit que ce n\u2019est que lorsqu\u2019on lui a parl\u00e9 du formulaire \u00e0 remplir, en mai 2023, qu\u2019elle a compris ce qu\u2019elle devait faire.\n[15] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en consid\u00e9ration par la Commission, mais que celle-ci a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne pouvaient constituer un motif raisonnable justifiant un retard de plus de deux ans.\n[16] La prestataire a reconnu devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avoir re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision initiale de la Commission qui mentionne clairement l\u2019importance du d\u00e9lai de 30 jours et comment obtenir un formulaire de r\u00e9vision en ligne, par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou en se pr\u00e9sentant \u00e0 un centre de Service Canada.\n[17] La d\u00e9cision initiale indique ce qui suit :\n\u00ab Les d\u00e9cisions que nous rendons reposent sur la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et son R\u00e8glement. Si vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumis toute l\u2019information pertinente et \u00eates en d\u00e9saccord avec cette (ces) d\u00e9cision(s), vous avez 30 jours suivant la date de cette lettre (ou \u00e0 partir de la date o\u00f9 vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 verbalement, si celle-ci pr\u00e9c\u00e8de) pour demander officiellement \u00e0 la Commission de faire une r\u00e9vision. Pour obtenir plus de renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on de demander une r\u00e9vision et pour obtenir le formulaire Demande de r\u00e9vision d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019assurance-emploi, consultez notre site au www.canada.ca\/fr\/services\/prestations\/ae\/assuranceemploi-revision-decision.html, composez le 1-800-808-6352 ou visitez le Centre Service Canada le plus proche. \u00bbNote de bas page 2\n[18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la Commission avait correctement exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire n'avait pas d'explication raisonnable pour le retard de plus de deux ans dans la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande de r\u00e9vision et qu'elle n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une intention continue de demander une r\u00e9vision. Elle n'avait donc aucun pouvoir pour modifier la d\u00e9cision initiale.\n[19] Je ne vois aucune erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle a correctement appliqu\u00e9 les faits au droit pour d\u00e9cider que la Commission avait agi de mani\u00e8re judiciaire lorsqu'elle a refus\u00e9 de prolonger le d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9vision.\nConclusion [20] La demande pour permission d\u2019en appeler n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en retard. La permission de faire appel n\u2019est toutefois pas accord\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir l\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l'emploi et du d\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir GD3-11.\n",

L\u2019appel ne passera pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] J. R (requ\u00e9rant) a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 au titre du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC) en mai 2021. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Le requ\u00e9rant lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2021, le ministre a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une lettre de d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision confirmant la d\u00e9cision de refuser la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9Note de bas page 1.\n[3] Le requ\u00e9rant a port\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision en appel devant le Tribunal le 5 mai 2023Note de bas page 2.\nQuestions en litige [4] Les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont les suivantes :\na) Peut\u2011on soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur dans sa d\u00e9cision au sujet de l\u2019appel en retard du requ\u00e9rant? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe refuse au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [5] Je peux donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si sa demande soul\u00e8ve une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis l\u2019une des erreurs suivantes :\nElle n\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; Elle a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence; Elle a commis une erreur de droit; Elle a commis une erreur de fait; Elle a commis une erreur dans l\u2019application du droit aux faitsNote de bas page 3.\n[6] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 4.\n[7] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nOn ne peut pas soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur au sujet de l\u2019appel en retard du requ\u00e9rant [8] Le requ\u00e9rant affirme que le retard dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement de sa faute et qu\u2019il y a eu une interruption des services postaux au d\u00e9but du processus. Il affirme que certains documents originaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus et sont arriv\u00e9s en retard, mais qu\u2019en fin de compte, le ministre a en sa possession tous les documents li\u00e9s \u00e0 son probl\u00e8me de vision qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 demander la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9Note de bas page 5.\n[9] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur.\n[10] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le requ\u00e9rant disposait de 90 jours \u00e0 compter du moment o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du ministre pour faire appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 6. Si le requ\u00e9rant ne respecte pas le d\u00e9lai de 90 jours, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut lui accorder une prolongation du d\u00e9lai pour faire appel. Toutefois, le requ\u00e9rant ne peut en aucun cas porter une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision en appel plus d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il en a re\u00e7u communication par le ministreNote de bas page 7.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tenu compte de l\u2019argument du requ\u00e9rant selon lequel il n\u2019a re\u00e7u la lettre de d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision que [traduction] \u00ab des mois apr\u00e8s la date imprim\u00e9e sur la lettre \u00bb parce qu\u2019il y avait eu une interruption des services postauxNote de bas page 8. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que le ministre a de nouveau \u00e9crit au requ\u00e9rant le 22 ao\u00fbt 2022 et a mentionn\u00e9 le rapport m\u00e9dical en double qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u en avril 2022 et la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2021.\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que m\u00eame si l\u2019on inclut dans le calcul les quelques mois qui ont suivi le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2021, le requ\u00e9rant avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an. Dans cette affaire, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder au requ\u00e9rant une prolongation de d\u00e9lai.\n[13] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucun argument concernant une erreur dans la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. La d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale tient d\u00e9j\u00e0 compte du retard dans la distribution du courrier, qui est le probl\u00e8me que le requ\u00e9rant soul\u00e8ve en ce qui concerne la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de prolonger le d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t au\u2011del\u00e0 d\u2019un an.\n[14] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas mal compris la preuve au sujet du retard dans le traitement du courrierNote de bas page 9. Elle a conclu que, m\u00eame compte tenu du retard dans la distribution du courrier, le requ\u00e9rant avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an. L\u2019appel ne peut en aucun cas aller de l\u2019avant lorsque le requ\u00e9rant le d\u00e9pose apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an.\nProchaines \u00e9tapes [15] Les documents contenus dans l\u2019appel du requ\u00e9rant permettent de croire que sa p\u00e9riode de couverture ne s\u2019est termin\u00e9e que le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2023. Et bien que l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles on lui a refus\u00e9 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 \u00e9tait qu\u2019il travaillait encore, il affirme qu\u2019il ne travaille plus maintenant.\n[16] Le requ\u00e9rant pourrait souhaiter pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du RPC en d\u00e9posant un nouveau formulaire de demande.\nConclusion [17] La permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a cess\u00e9 de travailler pour son employeur. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[3] La d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi r\u00e9guli\u00e8res parce qu\u2019il a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi pour l\u2019employeur sans motif valable au sens de la loi. Le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 et ne pas avoir quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision, la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. Le prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fourni de certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e0 son employeur pour la prolongation de son arr\u00eat de maladie et n\u2019a pas repris son emploi \u00e0 la fin de sa p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 autoris\u00e9.

La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi au sens de la loi.\n[5] Le prestataire demande maintenant \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il soutient que l\u2019employeur ne pouvait implicitement d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie et n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de quitter son emploi. Le prestataire fait valoir que l\u2019employeur avait l\u2019obligation de communiquer avec lui avant de rompre le lien d\u2019emploi. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9.\nQuestion en litige [6] Est-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [7] La loi sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\nLe processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on.

La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[8] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[9] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas la permission de faire appel au prestataire [10] Le prestataire soutient que l\u2019employeur ne pouvait implicitement d\u00e9duire qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son emploi. Il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie et n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de quitter son emploi. Le prestataire fait valoir que l\u2019employeur avait l\u2019obligation de communiquer avec lui avant de rompre le lien d\u2019emploi. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9guis\u00e9.\n[11] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale que, m\u00eame si le motif de la perte d'emploi est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 soit comme \u00e9tant de l'inconduite ou un d\u00e9part volontaire non fond\u00e9, la comp\u00e9tence de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le bien-fond\u00e9 de l'exclusion aux prestations.Note de bas page 1\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fourni de certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e0 son employeur pour la prolongation de son arr\u00eat de maladie et n\u2019a pas repris son emploi \u00e0 la fin de sa p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 autoris\u00e9. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire avait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi. Il aurait d\u00fb s\u2019assurer d\u2019avoir une prolongation de son arr\u00eat de travail dans les d\u00e9lais ou se pr\u00e9senter au travail si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi au sens de la loi.\n[13] La preuve devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u00e9montre que l\u2019arr\u00eat de travail du prestataire prenait fin le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2022. Il ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maladie autoris\u00e9. Le prestataire a prolong\u00e9 son absence du travail pendant une dur\u00e9e qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par son employeur. Il a donc volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi sans justification au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. (Loi sur L\u2019AE).\n[14] Tel que d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le prestataire avait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi. Il aurait d\u00fb s\u2019assurer d\u2019avoir une prolongation de son arr\u00eat de travail dans les d\u00e9lais ou se pr\u00e9senter au travail si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[15] De plus, l\u2019erreur du prestataire sur la date de son retour au travail d\u00e9note \u00e9galement de l\u2019insouciance quant \u00e0 ses obligations envers son employeur. Le d\u00e9faut d\u2019un prestataire d'appeler son employeur pour le pr\u00e9venir de son absence ou une absence au travail sans permission constitue de l\u2019inconduite aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019AE.Note de bas page 2\n[16] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9part volontaire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le prestataire, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, n\u2019avait d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi.\n[17] Un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une occasion pour le prestataire de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa position et esp\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Je constate que le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit ou de fait ou de comp\u00e9tence dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [19] La permission de faire appel n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir les d\u00e9cisions : Easson (A-1598-92), Dufour (A-1398-92) et Eppel (A-3-95).\nNote de bas de page 2\nLes juges-arbitres ont toujours soutenu que le d\u00e9faut d'appeler son employeur pour le pr\u00e9venir de son absence constituait une inconduite aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (d\u00e9cisions CUB 18712, 18006, 17984, 26713, 32458 et 57141, 66436).\n",

Il a fait valoir ne pas avoir quitt\u00e9 pour prendre sa retraite. Il a soutenu que le climat de travail \u00e9tait toxique et avoir longtemps fait l\u2019objet d\u2019intimidation et de menaces au travail de la part de la direction.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire ne voulait pas recommencer \u00e0 travailler cinq jours par semaine apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler quatre jours par semaine par son directeur. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en 2020 un grief \u00e0 cette fin. Deux jours avant l\u2019audience devant un tribunal d\u2019arbitrage, et afin de r\u00e9gler le grief, les parties ont sign\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019entente pr\u00e9voyant le d\u00e9part volontaire du prestataire au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2022. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la preuve ne soutenait pas la position du prestataire \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il avait sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente parce qu\u2019il avait subi des menaces et de l\u2019intimidation au travail de la part de son employeur.\n[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire avait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi. Il aurait pu accepter de travailler cinq jours par semaine dans l\u2019attente du r\u00e9sultat de son grief. Il aurait pu continuer son emploi afin de trouver un autre emploi qui lui serait plus convenable.\n[13] La question dont \u00e9tait saisie la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait de savoir si le prestataire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi au titre de l\u2019article 29 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE).\n[14] Pour d\u00e9cider si une personne \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter volontairement un emploi, il faut d\u00e9cider si elle n\u2019avait aucune autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances.\n[15] Malgr\u00e9 les nombreuses circonstances d\u00e9crites \u00e0 l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE qui constitueraient une justification au fait de quitter volontairement son emploi, la question principale demeure la m\u00eame : le prestataire avait-il d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi ?\n[16] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire avait les choix suivants : proc\u00e9der avec l\u2019audition devant le tribunal d\u2019arbitrage ou choisir de signer l\u2019entente de d\u00e9part propos\u00e9e par son employeur. Le syndicat du prestataire a rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019employeur et, apr\u00e8s discussion entre toutes les parties, le prestataire a choisi la deuxi\u00e8me option.\n[17] L\u2019entente pr\u00e9voit que le prestataire s\u2019engage \u00e0 quitter son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019employeur et ce, au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2022.Note de bas de page 2 Les parties reconnaissent que le contenu de l\u2019entente refl\u00e8te fid\u00e8lement l\u2019entente intervenue entre les parties entre elles et d\u00e9clarent avoir sign\u00e9 l\u2019entente librement et apr\u00e8s juste consid\u00e9ration.Note de bas de page 3\n[18] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur r\u00e9visable en concluant \u00e0 partir de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e que le prestataire a volontairement quitt\u00e9 son emploi et qu\u2019un autre choix raisonnable s\u2019offrait \u00e0 lui. Il aurait pu accepter de travailler cinq jours par semaine afin de conserver son emploi, au moins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue par le tribunal d\u2019arbitrage. Il aurait pu \u00e9galement continuer ses recherches d\u2019emploi afin de trouver un emploi qui lui \u00e9tait plus convenable.Note de bas de page 4\n[19] Le prestataire a pris la d\u00e9cision avec son syndicat de quitter son emploi au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2022. Il a choisi de ne pas proc\u00e9der devant le tribunal d\u2019arbitrage. Tel que soulign\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la preuve ne permet pas de conclure que l\u2019employeur a forc\u00e9 le prestataire \u00e0 signer l\u2019entente de d\u00e9part.\n[20] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9part volontaire. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le prestataire, apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 toutes les circonstances, n\u2019avait d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que de quitter son emploi. Il ne faut pas perdre de vue que l\u2019objectif premier de la Loi sur l\u2019AE est d\u2019indemniser les prestataires ayant involontairement perdu leur emploi.\n[21] Un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une occasion pour le prestataire de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa position et esp\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Je constate que le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit ou de fait ou de comp\u00e9tence dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\n[22] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [23] La permission de faire appel n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir l\u2019argumentation compl\u00e8te du prestataire, AD1-1 \u00e0 AD1-54.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir Lettre d\u2019entente et transaction-quittance relative au grief 2020-01, para. 2.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir Lettre d\u2019entente et transaction-quittance relative au grief 2020-01, para. 10.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir Stavropoulos c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2020 CAF 109; La Cour a conclu que le prestataire avait un choix en ce qu\u2019il aurait pu se pr\u00e9valoir de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019arbitrage pour contester les mesures prises par son employeur plut\u00f4t que choisir de quitter son emploi.\n",

Il est un ancien conducteur de chariot \u00e0 fourche. Il a travaill\u00e9 pour X pendant pr\u00e8s de 20 ans. Au fil du temps, il a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 de graves douleurs au dos qui l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de se pencher et de soulever des objets de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9titive. Ses douleurs l\u2019emp\u00eachaient aussi de rester debout ou assis pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes. Finalement, l\u2019imagerie a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 de multiples hernies discales \u00e0 la colonne vert\u00e9brale. X l\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2010.\n[3] Par la suite, l\u2019appelant a obtenu un permis de courtier immobilier, mais il affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais pu gagner sa vie dans ce domaine en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. En juin 2022, il a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 la demande apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tabli que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e avant la fin de sa p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, qui a pris fin le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2014Note de bas de page 1.\n[4] L\u2019appelant a port\u00e9 le refus du ministre en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. Elle a tenu une audience par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence avant de rejeter l\u2019appel. Elle a conclu que, m\u00eame si l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019exercer son emploi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de conducteur de chariot \u00e0 fourche, il \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame capable d\u2019occuper un emploi non physique.\n[5] Par la suite, l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission de faire appel. Selon lui, la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale contenait diff\u00e9rentes erreurs. \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, une de mes coll\u00e8gues de la division d\u2019appel lui a donn\u00e9 la permission de passer \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape.\n[6] J\u2019ai tenu une audience pour discuter en d\u00e9tail du fait que l\u2019appelant conteste le r\u00e9sultat de sa demande de pension. En plein milieu de l\u2019audience, le repr\u00e9sentant du ministre a demand\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on impromptue une conf\u00e9rence de r\u00e8glement. Les parties y ont conclu un accord et elles m\u2019ont demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9diger une d\u00e9cision qui refl\u00e8te l\u2019accord.\nAccord [7] Le ministre a reconnu que l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait invalide depuis d\u00e9cembre 2014, le dernier mois o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait couvert contre l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 par le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Le ministre a admis que les maux de dos chroniques de l\u2019appelant le rendaient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement incapable de d\u00e9tenir une occupation v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratrice durant sa p\u00e9riode minimale d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et depuis ce tempsNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] L\u2019appelant a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec ces d\u00e9clarations.\nConclusion [9] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019accord conclu entre les parties. Comme le ministre a re\u00e7u la demande de prestations en juin 2022, l\u2019appelant est r\u00e9put\u00e9 invalide \u00e0 compter de mars 2021Note de bas de page 3.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] P. L. (requ\u00e9rant) a atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans en juin 2022. Il a demand\u00e9 une pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC) le 29 novembre 2022. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir sa pension de retraite le mois suivant, en d\u00e9cembre 2022.\n[3] En mars 2023, le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 au ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social de r\u00e9viser le paiement mensuel et la date de d\u00e9but de sa pension de retraite.\n[4] La d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du ministre n\u2019a modifi\u00e9 ni la date de d\u00e9but ni le calcul des paiements de pension.\n[5] Le requ\u00e9rant a fait appel devant le Tribunal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 son appel. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 ce que sa pension de retraite commence plus t\u00f4t. Le ministre a correctement calcul\u00e9 la pension de retraite.\nQuestions en litige [6] Les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont les suivantes :\na) Peut\u2011on soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur dans sa d\u00e9cision au sujet de la date de d\u00e9but de la pension de retraite du RPC du requ\u00e9rant? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [7] Je peux donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande soul\u00e8ve une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis l\u2019une des erreurs suivantes :\nElle n\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; Elle a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence; Elle a commis une erreur de droit; Elle a commis une erreur de fait; Elle a commis une erreur dans l\u2019application du droit aux faitsNote de bas page 1.\n[8] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 2.\n[9] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis une erreur [10] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb permettre que ses paiements de pension commencent plus t\u00f4t, de sorte qu\u2019elle a tir\u00e9 la mauvaise conclusion dans son appel. Il avait de bonnes raisons de pr\u00e9senter une demande plus tard que pr\u00e9vu : certains documents \u00e0 son domicile ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9gar\u00e9s en raison de dommages caus\u00e9s par l\u2019eau et son \u00e9pouse est maladeNote de bas page 3.\n[11] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, on ne peut pas soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur, de sorte que je ne peux pas donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel. Le requ\u00e9rant a de bonnes raisons d\u2019avoir mis plus de temps que pr\u00e9vu pour demander sa pension de retraite. Toutefois, le RPC pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 quel moment la pension de retraite peut commencer. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, puisque le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 une pension avant d\u2019avoir 65 ans, cette pension est payable \u00e0 compter du dernier en date des mois suivants :\nle mois au cours duquel le requ\u00e9rant atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans; le mois suivant celui au cours duquel la demande du requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le ministre; le mois que choisit le requ\u00e9rant dans sa demandeNote de bas page 4.\n[12] Dans le cas du requ\u00e9rant, le dernier en date des mois est le mois de d\u00e9cembre 2022 (le mois suivant celui au cours duquel la demande du requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le ministre)Note de bas page 5. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de modifier la date de d\u00e9but de la pension du requ\u00e9rant, malgr\u00e9 les motifs que ce dernier a donn\u00e9s pour expliquer le fait que le ministre a re\u00e7u sa demande plus tard que pr\u00e9vu. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux pas conclure dans cette affaire que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a peut\u2011\u00eatre commis une erreur dans sa d\u00e9cision concernant la date de d\u00e9but de la pension de retraite du requ\u00e9rant.\n[13] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait se conformer au RPC. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a suivi la loi et a conclu que la pension du requ\u00e9rant commence le mois suivant celui au cours duquel la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le ministre. Je ne vois aucune erreur possible dans l\u2019analyse de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[14] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de choisir une date diff\u00e9rente, compte tenu des renseignements fournis par le requ\u00e9rant. Le Tribunal ne peut pas non plus hausser les paiements mensuels en fonction des besoins financiers du requ\u00e9rant.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [15] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, de sorte que je ne peux pas non plus accorder la permission de faire appel pour ce motif.\n[16] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas fait fi de la preuve ni n\u2019a mal compris celle\u2011ciNote de bas page 6.\nConclusion [17] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi en date du 23 mars 2020. Une p\u00e9riode de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence (PUAE) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Le 6 avril 2020, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) a vers\u00e9 une avance de 2 000 $ au prestataire.\n[3] La Commission r\u00e9clame maintenant l\u2019avance de 2 000 $ au prestataire. Selon la Commission, le prestataire a re\u00e7u huit semaines de PUAE alors qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en p\u00e9riode de ch\u00f4mage pendant quatre semaines. Il doit donc rembourser les prestations vers\u00e9es en trop, soit l\u2019avance au montant de 2 000 $.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u quatre semaines de PUAE au taux de 500 $ pour un total de de 2 000 $ pour la p\u00e9riode du 22 mars 2020 au 18 avril 2020. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u la somme totale de 4 000 $. Il a donc re\u00e7u 2 000 $ en trop. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il doit rembourser la somme de 2 000 $ \u00e0 la Commission.\n[5] Le prestataire demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il ne devrait pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a retourn\u00e9 promptement au travail. Il soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas responsable du chevauchement de deux r\u00e9gimes et que la Commission doit assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de sa gestion d\u00e9ficiente.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si on peut soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur r\u00e9visable qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\n[7] Je refuse la permission d\u2019en appeler puisqu\u2019aucun des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9s par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [8] Est-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s?\nAnalyse [9] L\u2019article 58(1) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social, sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[10] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[11] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nEst-ce que le prestataire soul\u00e8ve, dans ses moyens d\u2019appel, une erreur r\u00e9visable qu\u2019aurait commise la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s? [12] Le prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019il ne devrait pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a retourn\u00e9 promptement au travail. Il soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas responsable du chevauchement de deux r\u00e9gimes et que la Commission doit assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 de sa gestion d\u00e9ficiente.\n[13] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire a re\u00e7u quatre semaines de PUAE au taux de 500 $ pour un total de de 2 000 $ pour la p\u00e9riode du 22 mars 2020 au 18 avril 2020. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a re\u00e7u la somme totale de 4 000 $. Il a donc re\u00e7u 2 000 $ en trop. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il doit rembourser \u00e0 la Commission la somme de 2 000 $.\n[14] Je constate que la loi mise en vigueur pendant la pand\u00e9mie permet \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser si une personne a re\u00e7u une somme \u00e0 titre de PUAE pour laquelle elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible. La loi indique clairement que la personne doit rembourser la PUAE vers\u00e9e en trop.Note de bas de page 1\n[15] De plus, la jurisprudence de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tablit clairement qu\u2019une somme re\u00e7ue sans droit par un prestataire, m\u00eame suivant une erreur de la Commission, ne dispense pas de rembourser cette somme.Note de bas de page 2\n[16] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a donc commis aucune erreur r\u00e9visable en concluant que le prestataire devait rembourser le trop-pay\u00e9 de PUAE.\n[17] La loi ne permet malheureusement aucun \u00e9cart et ne donne aucune discr\u00e9tion au Tribunal afin d\u2019annuler le montant du remboursement \u00e0 payer. Tel que soulign\u00e9 par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la loi accorde \u00e0 la Commission la comp\u00e9tence exclusive pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019annuler une dette qui lui est d\u00fb en vertu de la loi.Note de bas de page 3\n[18] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments du prestataire au soutien de sa demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\nConclusion [19] La permission d\u2019en appeler est refus\u00e9e.

La loi ne permet pas que la demande de la prestataire soit antidat\u00e9e au 29 mars 2020.\nAper\u00e7u [2] L\u2019appelante (prestataire) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations le 14 avril 2020. Une p\u00e9riode de prestations en Prestations d\u2019Urgence d\u2019Assurance Emploi (PUAE) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au 29 mars 2020. Cependant, la prestataire n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses d\u00e9clarations du prestataire. Le 4 avril 2022, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Commission) que sa demande soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme si elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses d\u00e9clarations du prestataire \u00e0 compter du 29 mars 2020. Elle a demand\u00e9 une antidatation de sa demande.\n[3] La Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision indiquant que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas fourni un motif valable justifiant son retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande pour la p\u00e9riode du 29 mars 2020 au 4 avril 2022. La prestataire a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9vision mais la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. La prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9coulant de la r\u00e9vision aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la loi ne permettait pas que la demande de la prestataire soit antidat\u00e9e au 29 mars 2020. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019au 27 septembre 2020, les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9taient satisfaites et que la prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un motif valable justifiant son retard \u00e0 cette date. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la demande de la prestataire pouvait seulement \u00eatre antidat\u00e9e au 27 septembre 2020.\n[5] La prestataire a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elle fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur car elle n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 que sa demande soit antidat\u00e9e au 27 septembre 2020.

[12] La prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande initiale de prestations le 14 avril 2020 et une p\u00e9riode de prestations en PUAE a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au 29 mars 2020. Bien qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, la prestataire n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune d\u00e9claration du prestataire.\n[13] Le 4 avril 2022, la prestataire a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que sa demande soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme si elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses d\u00e9clarations du prestataire \u00e0 compter du 29 mars 2020. Elle a demand\u00e9 une antidatation de sa demande.\n[14] Lors de l\u2019audience devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au terme de plusieurs traitements et examens qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de maladie chronique. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle a pris une m\u00e9dication qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrite par son m\u00e9decin, mais ce m\u00e9dicament n\u2019\u00e9tait pas adapt\u00e9 puisqu\u2019elle ressentait toujours des douleurs et qu\u2019elle a eu de nombreux effets secondaires. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a ressenti des effets secondaires qui sont tr\u00e8s rares lors de la prise de ce m\u00e9dicament.\n[15] La prestataire a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement confuse et que sa m\u00e9moire \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e. Malgr\u00e9 la prise de ce m\u00e9dicament, elle avait toujours des sympt\u00f4mes et elle a d\u00fb \u00eatre sevr\u00e9e avant que son m\u00e9decin la dirige vers une autre solution. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a ressenti \u00e9galement des effets secondaires pendant son sevrage et que, par la suite, elle a subi une chirurgie.\n[16] Un billet m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 3 novembre 2022 et sign\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin indique que la prestataire n\u2019a pas pu compl\u00e9ter les d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019assurance-emploi en raison de la \u00ab lourde m\u00e9dication \u00bb qu\u2019elle devait prendre pendant cette p\u00e9riode et qui lui causait de la somnolence. Le m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9cise que cette omission est \u00ab vraiment \u00bb attribuable aux effets de la m\u00e9dication.\n[17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 les explications de la prestataire quant \u00e0 son retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ses d\u00e9clarations du prestataire parce qu\u2019il existait des circonstances exceptionnelles qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait de les produire dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits.\n[18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019article 153.8(2) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE) indique qu\u2019aucune demande de PUAE ne peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2020. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas satisfaites pour recevoir des prestations en PUAE parce que, lorsqu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations le 4 avril 2022, le d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait prescrit pour demander des prestations en PUAE.\n[19] Cependant, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la prestataire pouvait obtenir que sa demande soit antidat\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode en PUAE pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur, soit le 27 septembre 2020.Note de bas de page 2\n[20] L\u2019article 10(5) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE indique que lorsque le prestataire pr\u00e9sente une demande de prestations, autre qu\u2019une demande initiale, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu par r\u00e8glement pour la pr\u00e9senter, la demande doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 une date ant\u00e9rieure si celui-ci d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il avait, durant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e entre cette date ant\u00e9rieure et la date \u00e0 laquelle il pr\u00e9sente sa demande, un motif valable justifiant son retard.\n[21] Il est vrai que le but de l\u2019article 10(5) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE est de permettre qu\u2019un prestataire qui a tard\u00e9 pour de justes motifs \u00e0 formuler sa demande de prestations soit plac\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame situation que si ce retard n'avait pas eu lieu.Note de bas de page 3\n[22] Cependant, au moment o\u00f9 la prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations, des mesures temporaires \u00e9taient en vigueur en raison de la pand\u00e9mie de la COVID-19. Un prestataire qui pr\u00e9sentait une demande de prestations pendant cette p\u00e9riode recevait plut\u00f4t des prestations en PUAE.Note de bas de page 4\n[23] Malheureusement, pour la prestataire, l\u2019article 10(5) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE se retrouve sous la partie I de la Loi sur l\u2019AE. Or, le l\u00e9gislateur a sp\u00e9cifiquement pr\u00e9vu que cette disposition ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une demande en PUAE.Note de bas de page 5\n[24] Je ne peux que constater que la loi ne permet pas au Tribunal d'accorder \u00e0 la prestataire d'antidatation pour la p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure au 27 septembre 2020.\n[25] Je sympathise grandement avec la prestataire qui semble se retrouver dans une situation non pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur lors de l\u2019adoption des mesures temporaires lors de la pand\u00e9mie. Je n\u2019ai cependant pas le pouvoir de modifier la loi afin de lui permettre que sa demande soit antidat\u00e9e au 29 mars 2020.\n[26] Je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a commis aucune erreur de droit en d\u00e9cidant que la loi ne permettait pas que la demande de la prestataire soit antidat\u00e9e au 29 mars 2020.\nConclusion [27] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9. La loi ne permet pas que la demande de la prestataire soit antidat\u00e9e au 29 mars 2020.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Jean, 2015 CAF 242; Maunder c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 274.\nNote de bas de page 2\nLes personnes qui n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u de PUAE pouvaient demander des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 compter du 27 septembre 2020.\nNote de bas de page 3\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Piche, A-248-80.\nNote de bas de page 4\nLa loi stipule que pour la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 15 mars 2020 et se terminant le 26 septembre 2020, aucune p\u00e9riode de prestations ne doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des prestations d'assurance-emploi sous le r\u00e9gime de la partie I.

L\u2019appel ne passera pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] W. A. (requ\u00e9rant) est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 60 ans. Il s\u2019est mari\u00e9 avec la partie mise en cause le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Ils se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s le 2 novembre 2020. Leur divorce est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 13 mai 2022. Tous ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont eu lieu au Manitoba, o\u00f9 la partie mise en cause et le requ\u00e9rant vivent encore.\n[3] La partie mise en cause a demand\u00e9 le partage des cr\u00e9dits du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC) le 25 mai 2022. Elle a demand\u00e9 le partage \u00e9gal des cotisations au RPC qu\u2019elle et le requ\u00e9rant ont vers\u00e9es pendant leur mariage et jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur s\u00e9paration. Le ministre a accueilli la demande et a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une r\u00e9vision. Le requ\u00e9rant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 au partage des cr\u00e9dits et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un appel. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel, concluant que le partage des cr\u00e9dits du RPC avait \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi. Aucune des exceptions possibles au partage obligatoire des cr\u00e9dits ne s\u2019appliquait.\nQuestions en litige [4] Les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont les suivantes :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait\u2011elle avoir commis une erreur justifiant que le requ\u00e9rant soit autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire appel? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [5] Je peux donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande soul\u00e8ve une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis l\u2019une des erreurs suivantes :\nElle n\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; Elle a exc\u00e9d\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence; Elle a commis une erreur de droit; Elle a commis une erreur de fait; Elle a commis une erreur dans l\u2019application des faits au droitNote de bas page 1.\n[6] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 2.\n[7] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur [8] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 d\u2019argument qui justifierait de lui accorder la permission de faire appel.\n[9] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que le partage des cr\u00e9dits est injuste parce qu\u2019il a des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a soutenu plus que financi\u00e8rement la partie mise en cause.\n[10] Devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer que le ministre a appliqu\u00e9 erron\u00e9ment le partage des cr\u00e9dits du RPC. Comme l\u2019explique la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans sa d\u00e9cision, le partage des cr\u00e9dits est obligatoire une fois que le ministre re\u00e7oit les renseignements exig\u00e9s par le R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime de pensions du CanadaNote de bas page 3.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale explique \u00e9galement dans sa d\u00e9cision que le partage ne peut avoir lieu s\u2019il r\u00e9duit le droit au RPC pour les deux conjoints ou dans certains cas o\u00f9 une ordonnance du tribunal interdit le partage des cr\u00e9dits ou encore o\u00f9 un contrat \u00e9crit est conclu pour \u00e9viter le partage des cr\u00e9dits. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucune preuve que le partage des cr\u00e9dits r\u00e9duisait le droit de la partie mise en cause, et il n\u2019y avait non plus aucune ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal ni aucun contrat pour \u00e9viter le partage des cr\u00e9dits.\n[12] Le requ\u00e9rant a des raisons de souhaiter ne pas partager les cr\u00e9dits de pension, mais ces raisons ne peuvent pas justifier que je lui donne la permission de porter la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en appel. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 la loi sur le partage des cr\u00e9dits \u00e0 la situation factuelle du requ\u00e9rant. Le r\u00e9sultat n\u2019est pas ce que le requ\u00e9rant souhaitait, mais il n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucune cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir commis une erreur.\nIl n\u2019y a devant la division d\u2019appel aucune nouvelle preuve qui justifierait que j\u2019accorde la permission de faire appel [13] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 sa disposition. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui justifierait que je donne au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel.\n[14] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier et je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas fait fi de la preuve ou mal compris celle\u2011ci concernant le partage des cr\u00e9dits de pension dans le pr\u00e9sent appelNote de bas page 4.\nConclusion [15] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel.

L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations au sens de la LoiNote de bas de page 1. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019imposer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un centre de denturologie. Le personnel comprend quatre denturologistes et une adjointe administrative.\n[3] Le 18 septembre 2021, l\u2019adjointe administrative du centre quitte son emploi en raison d\u2019un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Elle doit revenir au travail vers le mois d\u2019octobre 2022.\n[4] Pendant ce temps, la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et une amie se partagent les heures de travail. \u00c0 l\u2019automne 2022, l\u2019adjointe administrative informe l\u2019appelant qu\u2019elle ne reviendra pas au travail.\n[5] L\u2019appelant affiche le poste pour un emploi \u00e0 temps plein. Au mois de novembre 2022, il engage une nouvelle adjointe administrative. Il met fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de sa conjointe et de son amie.\n[6] Elles se pr\u00e9sentent dans un centre de Service Canada, afin de s\u2019informer de leur droit \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Elles comprennent qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas le droit de recevoir des prestations, parce qu\u2019elles ne veulent plus travailler \u00e0 temps plein. L\u2019une est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 77 ans et l\u2019autre de 67 ans. Elles sont toutes deux retrait\u00e9es. Elles ont d\u00e9pann\u00e9 l\u2019appelant pendant le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de l\u2019adjointe administrative.\n[7] La Commission ouvre une enqu\u00eate. Elle semble soup\u00e7onner que les emplois sont fictifs.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s avoir recueilli des informations aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019appelant, des deux employ\u00e9es, des services comptables de l\u2019appelant, elle conclut que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations. Elle lui impose une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 8000 $.\n[9] L\u2019appelant pr\u00e9sente une demande de r\u00e9vision. Il soutient ne pas avoir fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations. Il y avait une fin de contrat pour les deux employ\u00e9es qui ne voulaient pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un travail temporaire dans l\u2019attente du retour de l\u2019adjointe administrative en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[10] En r\u00e9vision, la Commission maintient sa d\u00e9cision concernant les fausses d\u00e9clarations, mais diminue la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 3200 $.\nQuestions en litige\nEst-ce que l\u2019appelant a fait deux fausses d\u00e9clarations ? Si oui, est-ce que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en imposant une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 3200 $ \u00e0 l\u2019appelant ?\nQuestion en litige no 1 : Est-ce que l\u2019appelant a fait deux fausses d\u00e9clarations ? [11] Lorsque la Commission soutient qu\u2019une personne a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration sciemment, c\u2019est elle qui doit en faire la preuveNote de bas de page 2. Il doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Ainsi, il doit \u00eatre plus probable que la personne a fait une fausse d\u00e9claration.\n[12] La Commission doit d\u00e9montrer que la personne a donn\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse inexacte \u00e0 une question tr\u00e8s simpleNote de bas de page 3. Si elle le d\u00e9montre, il y a un renversement du fardeau de preuve. C\u2019est maintenant \u00e0 la personne de fournir une explication raisonnable justifiant que la fausse d\u00e9claration n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite volontairement.\n[13] Pour interpr\u00e9ter le mot \u00ab sciemment \u00bb, il faut utiliser un crit\u00e8re subjectif pour d\u00e9terminer si la connaissance requise existe. \u00ab Il ne suffit pas de proclamer son ignorance pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 des sanctions : il est permis de tenir compte du bon sens et de facteurs objectifs pour d\u00e9cider si un prestataire avait la connaissance subjective de la fausset\u00e9 de ses d\u00e9clarations \u00bbNote de bas de page 4.\n[14] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je retiens que l\u2019appelant est propri\u00e9taire d\u2019un centre de denturologie depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Une adjointe administrative prend en charge la gestion du centre pour soutenir quatre denturologistes.\n[15] En 2021, l\u2019adjointe administrative cesse de travailler en raison d\u2019un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Devant les difficult\u00e9s de recruter une rempla\u00e7ante en p\u00e9riode de pand\u00e9mie, la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et une amie se partagent le travail pendant le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de l\u2019adjointe. Elles doivent cesser de travailler lors de son retour.\n[16] L\u2019adjointe informe l\u2019appelant qu\u2019elle quitte son emploi. Elle ne reviendra donc pas travailler apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. L\u2019appelant doit donc proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019embauche d\u2019une nouvelle adjointe. Il s\u2019est entendu avec sa conjointe et son amie que le contrat se termine lors d\u2019un retour de l\u2019adjointe, mais en raison de sa d\u00e9mission, ce sera lors de l\u2019embauche de la nouvelle adjointe.\n[17] La nouvelle adjointe est finalement embauch\u00e9e au mois de novembre 2022. La conjointe de l\u2019appelant cesse de travailler. L\u2019amie termine quelques semaines plus tard, afin de former la nouvelle adjointe. Elles ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 claires : elles ne veulent pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Elles ont respectivement 77 et 67 ans.\n[18] Une demande est achemin\u00e9e au comptable du centre, afin qu\u2019il \u00e9mette deux cessations d\u2019emploi. Sur le relev\u00e9, il y est indiqu\u00e9 manque de travail\/fin de contrat. La conjointe de l\u2019appelant ainsi que son amie s\u2019informent \u00e0 la Commission pour savoir si elles peuvent recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[19] Le comptable qui s\u2019occupait des affaires du centre a quitt\u00e9 son emploi. Il est remplac\u00e9 par une nouvelle comptable. Cette derni\u00e8re remplit les relev\u00e9s d\u2019emploi en indiquant : manque de travail\/fin de contrat.\n[20] Le 9 janvier 2023, la Commission communique avec la comptable qui a rempli les relev\u00e9s d\u2019emploi. Cette derni\u00e8re l\u2019informe qu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 8 novembre 2022. Elle ne connait pas tous les d\u00e9tails. Elle confirme que la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et son amie ont travaill\u00e9 en 2022. \u00c9galement, il y aurait une erreur sur le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi d\u2019une employ\u00e9e. Elle devra faire les corrections.\n[21] Le 9 janvier 2023, la Commission communique avec la conjointe de l\u2019appelant pour obtenir des informations concernant son emploi. Elle travaillait combien d\u2019heures, quelles \u00e9taient ses t\u00e2ches\u2026\n[22] Toujours le 9 janvier 2023, la Commission tente de rejoindre l\u2019appelant sans succ\u00e8s.\n[23] Le 10 janvier 2023, la Commission communique avec l\u2019amie de la conjointe. Elle s\u2019informe sur le lien entre cette derni\u00e8re et l\u2019appelant ou sa conjointe. Elle lui pose des questions concernant ses t\u00e2ches de travail, si elle paie une pension lorsqu\u2019elle demeure chez le couple.\n[24] Je constate que les questions de la Commission visent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019amie est une personne li\u00e9e. Et si les postes ont r\u00e9ellement exist\u00e9.\n[25] Le 10 janvier 2023, elle communique de nouveau avec la conjointe de l\u2019appelante. Les questions portent principalement sur le fonctionnement du centre et les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019appelante.\n[26] Le 10 janvier 2023, la Commission communique de nouveau avec la nouvelle comptable. Elle lui demande si la conjointe de l\u2019appelant a travaill\u00e9 en 2021. En fait, elle veut obtenir des informations sur l\u2019entreprise.\n[27] Le 10 janvier 2023, la Commission communique encore une fois avec la conjointe de l\u2019appelant. Cette fois-ci, elle d\u00e9cide de transmettre \u00e0 l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada le dossier de l\u2019entreprise pour d\u00e9terminer si les heures effectu\u00e9es par la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et son amie sont des heures assurables.\n[28] Le 11 janvier 2023, la Commission communique avec l\u2019amie de la conjointe. Elle l\u2019informe que ses heures de travail sont certainement assurables, mais elle n\u2019est pas admissible parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas disponible pour travailler \u00e0 temps plein.\n[29] Le 12 janvier 2023, la Commission demande \u00e0 la nouvelle comptable les ch\u00e8ques de payes. Elle lui demande de transmettre au moins un ch\u00e8que \u00e9mis par elle pour un fournisseur.\n[30] Je comprends des nombreuses demandes de la Commission qu\u2019elle cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019entreprise existe et si les personnes ont r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 cet endroit. Il n\u2019est pas encore question du motif de la fin d\u2019emploi de la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et de son ami.\n[31] Je constate que la Commission va poursuivre ses communications avec l\u2019appelant, la conjointe de l\u2019appelant et l\u2019amie.\n[32] Le 23 janvier 2023, la Commission communique avec la nouvelle comptable. Elle insiste pour obtenir des documents. La nouvelle comptable d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas l\u2019autorisation de transmettre les documents.\n[33] Le 25 janvier 2023, la Commission rejoint l\u2019appelant. Les questions visent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le r\u00f4le de chacun dans l\u2019entreprise. Elle veut \u00e9galement obtenir les documents de la compagnie.\n[34] Il s\u2019en suit des discussions entre la Commission et la nouvelle comptable, la conjointe de l\u2019appelant, l\u2019appelant et l\u2019amie de la conjointe.\n[35] Apr\u00e8s avoir lu les informations recueillies par la Commission, je ne sais pas encore quels sont les objectifs. Est-ce de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une entreprise fictive, de travailleurs fictifs, l\u2019implication des 4 personnes dans l\u2019entreprise ? On pourrait qualifier le processus de partie de p\u00eache. En effet, selon les notes, les personnes ne savent pas vraiment les raisons de toutes ces questions.\n[36] \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission soutient que l\u2019appelant savait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de fausses d\u00e9clarations, puisqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision concernant la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 pour avoir fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations.\n[37] Je comprends la position de la Commission. Cependant, je ne suis pas totalement d\u2019accord avec son interpr\u00e9tation. En fait, apr\u00e8s plusieurs contacts t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques entre le mois de janvier et f\u00e9vrier o\u00f9 il n\u2019est pas question de fausses d\u00e9clarations sur le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, la Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 12 juin 2023 concernant les fausses d\u00e9clarations. J\u2019y reviendrais.\n[38] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2023, dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate, la Commission demande \u00e0 la comptable si on lui a demand\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer un manque de travail. Selon les notes de la Commission, elle r\u00e9pond : \u00ab Elle avait une note sur son bureau mentionnant que l\u2019employeur avait appel\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle devait faire les relev\u00e9s d\u2019emploi avec comme raison une fin de contrat \u00bb.Note de bas de page 5\n[39] Toujours selon les notes, la nouvelle comptable r\u00e9p\u00e8te \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu\u2019elle ne sait pas la r\u00e9ponse, parce qu\u2019elle est nouvelle. Elle pense des choses, mais elle n\u2019est pas certaine.\n[40] Et l\u00e0, l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission prend un tournant. Elle soutient que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations, parce qu\u2019il a indiqu\u00e9 \u00ab manque de travail\/fin de contrat \u00bb, alors qu\u2019il y avait encore du travail, puisqu\u2019il a engag\u00e9 une nouvelle personne \u00e0 temps plein.\n[41] Le 3 avril 2023, la Commission discute avec la nouvelle comptable, elle r\u00e9it\u00e8re que de m\u00e9moire, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fin de contratNote de bas de page 6. Encore une fois, la nouvelle comptable ne sait pas vraiment ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9.\n[42] Le 12 juin 2023, la Commission impose une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 8000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019appelant pour avoir fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations.\n[43] Selon la Commission, l\u2019appelant a fourni de faux renseignements sur le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi. Il savait que les employ\u00e9es seraient remplac\u00e9es par une employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein. Il voulait permettre aux deux employ\u00e9es de recevoir des prestations d\u2019Assurance-emploi.\n[44] La Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision dans le cadre de demande de l\u2019appelant concernant les fausses d\u00e9clarations. Toutefois, elle a diminu\u00e9 la p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 3200 $.\n[45] Dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent appel, la Commission soutient que c\u2019est la pr\u00e9sence de versions contradictoires qui doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es en acceptant la preuve qui est raisonnable, fiable et cr\u00e9dible en regard des circonstances. La Commission a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les versions des parties comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas cr\u00e9dible et se contredisant.\n[46] Elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019obtenir la feuille du compte bancaire personnelle ou de l\u2019entreprise. L\u2019appelant a refus\u00e9 de faire parvenir les ch\u00e8ques \u00e0 la Commission. Sa conjointe a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne connaissait rien \u00e0 la paperasse.\n[47] Toujours dans ses observations, la Commission maintient que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations, parce qu\u2019il a indiqu\u00e9 un manque de travail sur les relev\u00e9s d\u2019emploiNote de bas de page 7.\n[48] Pourtant, la Commission affirme que la comptable a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fin de contrat.Note de bas de page 8\n[49] Pour sa part, l\u2019appelant r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019il avait une entente avec sa conjointe de 77 ans et l\u2019amie de cette derni\u00e8re de 67 ans, afin de remplacer l\u2019adjointe administrative en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Leur contrat se terminait lors du retour de cette derni\u00e8re.\n[50] La preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste. La conjointe a cess\u00e9 de travailler au mois de novembre 2022, lors de l\u2019embauche de la nouvelle adjointe. Son amie est demeur\u00e9e en poste jusqu\u2019au mois de janvier 2023 pour soutenir la nouvelle adjointe. Entre-temps, le centre a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu \u00e0 la fille de l\u2019appelant.\n[51] Apr\u00e8s avoir pris en compte la preuve au dossier, les t\u00e9moignages et les observations des parties, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations.\n[52] L\u2019appelant a toujours d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait une entente avec sa conjointe et une amie de cette derni\u00e8re pour effectuer des t\u00e2ches au centre. Elles se sont partag\u00e9 le travail pendant le cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 de l\u2019adjointe administrative. Elles devaient cesser de travailler, lors du retour de cette derni\u00e8re. Elles n\u2019ont jamais eu l\u2019intention de travailler \u00e0 temps plein. Elles ont 77 ans et 67 ans.\n[53] Leur travail a pris fin au moment de l\u2019embauche de la nouvelle adjointe. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019entente que les parties avaient depuis le d\u00e9but. L\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer fin de contrat sur le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi. Pour lui, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fin de contrat, puisqu\u2019elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es \u00e0 temps partiel pendant le remplacement.\n[54] D\u2019ailleurs, la nouvelle comptable a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but \u00e0 la Commission que l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer fin de contrat. Elle a inscrit un manque de travail\/fin de contrat. J\u2019estime qu\u2019on ne peut pas conclure \u00e0 de fausses d\u00e9clarations, parce que la nouvelle comptable a inscrit deux motifs. En fait, elle a suivi les r\u00e8gles indiqu\u00e9es par la Commission concernant une fin de contrat, il faut indiquer A dans la case 16.\n[55] Ainsi, ce n\u2019est pas suffisant pour conclure que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations, parce que la nouvelle comptable a indiqu\u00e9 les deux motifs \u00e0 la case A. La question du motif de la fin d\u2019emploi est simple, mais la r\u00e9ponse n\u2019est pas fausse comme le pr\u00e9tend la Commission. Il y a bel et bien une fin de contrat entre les parties.\n[56] Il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait l\u00e9gitime de la part de la conjointe et de l\u2019amie de pr\u00e9senter une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. C\u2019est la Commission qui d\u00e9cide si elles r\u00e9pondent aux crit\u00e8res. Visiblement, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux exigences de la Loi, parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps pleinNote de bas de page 9.\n[57] Concernant les contradictions soulev\u00e9es par la Commission, pour d\u00e9montrer que les personnes impliqu\u00e9es ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles, ils ne m\u2019ont pas convaincu. En effet, elles ont re\u00e7u plusieurs appels de la part de la Commission pendant une courte p\u00e9riode. Ce sont des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es et retrait\u00e9es et une nouvelle comptable qui ont fourni les renseignements autant qu\u2019elles sachent. Chacune a maintenu sa version des faits. Et ce n\u2019est pas parce que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il refusait de transmettre les documents et que sa conjointe pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il ne s\u2019y connait pas en documents qu\u2019ils ne sont pas cr\u00e9dibles et que les d\u00e9clarations sont fausses. M\u00eame si elles ont fourni des informations diff\u00e9rentes, cela n\u2019est pas suffisant pour d\u00e9montrer que de fausses d\u00e9clarations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites.\n[58] En effet, l\u2019appelant, sa conjointe, l\u2019amie de cette derni\u00e8re ainsi que la nouvelle comptable sont cr\u00e9dibles, lorsqu\u2019ils affirment qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une fin de contrat. Ce ne sont pas de fausses d\u00e9clarations.\n[59] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec la Commission que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations.\nQuestion en litige no 2. Si oui, est-ce que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire correctement en imposant une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 de 3200 $ \u00e0 l\u2019appelant ? [60] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations, il n\u2019y a pas lieu de lui imposer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9. Je n\u2019ai donc pas \u00e0 examiner si la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire correctement.\nConclusion [61] La Commission n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a fait de fausses d\u00e9clarations. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y a pas lieu d\u2019imposer une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9.\n[62] L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nArticle 39 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir Canada c Bellil, 2017 CAF 104\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir Bellil, 2017 CAF 104 par. 15 ; Purcell A-694-94 et Gates A-600-94\nNote de bas de page 4\nCanada c Bellil, 2017 CAF 104\nNote de bas de page 5\nGD3-28\nNote de bas de page 6\nGD3-29\nNote de bas de page 7\nGD4-4 6e paragraphe\nNote de bas de page 8\nGD4-4 5e paragraphe\nNote de bas de page 9\nJe en vais pas me prononcer sur cette affirmation de la Commission concernant la d\u00e9finition de la disponibilit\u00e9 au sens de la Loi.\n",

Il revient dans sa ville de r\u00e9sidence vers le 25 septembre 2022.\n[5] Le 1er novembre 2022, il pr\u00e9sente une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Il demande \u00e0 la Commission que sa demande soit effective \u00e0 partir du 25 septembre 2022.\n[6] L\u2019appelant justifie son retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande par le fait qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs de rejoindre un agent \u00e0 Service Canada. Il ne pouvait pas se d\u00e9placer avec son v\u00e9hicule qui devait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9. Il n\u2019avait pas eu de probl\u00e8me \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ses demandes par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pendant la pand\u00e9mie.\n[7] La Commission refuse la demande de l\u2019appelant concernant la pr\u00e9sentation de sa demande le 25 septembre 2022. Selon la Commission, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas un motif valable pour justifier son retard.\n[8] L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec la Commission. Il a tent\u00e9 de s\u2019informer aupr\u00e8s de la Commission sans succ\u00e8s.\nQuestion en litige [9] La demande initiale de l\u2019appelant peut\u2011elle \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 25 septembre 2022 ? C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab antidater \u00bb la demande initiale.\nAnalyse [10] Pour que sa demande initiale de prestations soit antidat\u00e9e, une personne doit prouver les deux choses suivantesNote de bas de page 2 :\na) qu\u2019elle avait un motif valable justifiant son retard durant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e. Autrement dit, qu\u2019elle avait une explication acceptable selon la loi ; b) qu\u2019\u00e0 la date ant\u00e9rieure (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la date \u00e0 laquelle elle veut que sa demande initiale soit antidat\u00e9e), elle remplissait les conditions requises pour recevoir des prestations.\n[11] Les arguments principaux dans cette affaire servent \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant avait un motif valable. C\u2019est donc par cela que je commencerai.\n[12] Pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il avait un motif valable, l\u2019appelant doit prouver qu\u2019il a agi comme une personne raisonnable et prudente l\u2019aurait fait dans des circonstances semblablesNote de bas de page 3. Autrement dit, il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a agi comme une personne raisonnable et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie aurait agi dans une situation semblable.\n[13] L\u2019appelant doit le prouver pour toute la p\u00e9riode du retardNote de bas de page 4. Cette p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tend du jour o\u00f9 il veut que sa demande initiale soit antidat\u00e9e au jour o\u00f9 il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette demande. Par cons\u00e9quent, la p\u00e9riode de retard de l\u2019appelant est du 25 septembre 2022 au 1er novembre 2022.\n[14] L\u2019appelant doit aussi d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 assez rapidement s\u2019il avait droit \u00e0 des prestations et quelles obligations la loi lui imposaitNote de bas de page 5. Cela veut dire que l\u2019appelant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a fait de son mieux pour essayer de s\u2019informer sur ses droits et ses responsabilit\u00e9s d\u00e8s que possible. Si l\u2019appelant ne l\u2019a pas fait, il doit alors d\u00e9montrer les circonstances exceptionnelles qui l\u2019en ont emp\u00each\u00e9Note de bas de page 6.\n[15] L\u2019appelant doit le d\u00e9montrer selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019il doit prouver qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019il avait un motif valable justifiant son retard.\n[16] Je retiens que l\u2019appelant travaille comme d\u00e9broussailleur dans le nord. En 2022, il est revenu vers le 24 septembre. Il s\u2019est fait intercepter par les policiers en raison de l\u2019\u00e9tat de son v\u00e9hicule. Il a re\u00e7u plusieurs constats qui l\u2019obligeaient \u00e0 faire des r\u00e9parations sur son v\u00e9hicule. Il n\u2019avait pas les moyens de d\u00e9bourser plus de 10 000 $.\n[17] Il a fait des d\u00e9marches pour s\u2019acheter une nouvelle voiture. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement tent\u00e9 de faire sa demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Cependant, il y a eu un bogue. Il ne pouvait pas se rendre au bureau de Service Canada. Il a tent\u00e9 de joindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone un agent, mais sans succ\u00e8s.\n[18] Il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au bureau de Service Canada vers le 1er novembre 2022. Il avait un v\u00e9hicule pour se rendre au bureau. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande et il a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit effectivement \u00e0 partir du 25 septembre 2022.\n[19] De plus, pendant la pand\u00e9mie, il n\u2019avait pas de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter ses demandes par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Il ne comprend pas pourquoi la situation a chang\u00e9.\n[20] Selon la Commission, l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas agi comme une personne raisonnable dans les circonstances. Il n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de joindre la Commission. Dans les faits, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande pour qu\u2019elle soit effective seulement le 1er novembre 2022. La Commission n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de rejoindre l\u2019appelant dans le cadre de sa demande de r\u00e9vision. Elle soutient que l\u2019appelant aurait d\u00fb s\u2019informer rapidement de ses droits.\n[21] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le dossier, entendu l\u2019appelant et pris en compte les repr\u00e9sentations de parties, j\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant a un motif valable pour justifier son retard.\n[22] Je constate que l\u2019appelant vit et travaille dans des lieux isol\u00e9s. Il ne peut compter que sur lui-m\u00eame pour subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins et faire des d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019a plus eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un v\u00e9hicule, il ne pouvait pas se d\u00e9placer pour obtenir des informations au bureau de Service Canada. Il a tent\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner sans succ\u00e8s. Il a \u00e9galement tent\u00e9 de remplir sa demande par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.\n[23] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 sa situation et les efforts qu\u2019il a faits pour remplir sa demande afin de recevoir des prestations. Aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il a eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un v\u00e9hicule, il a fait ses d\u00e9marches.\n[24] Par ailleurs, la Commission a mis en place une politique administrative pour traiter les demandes antidateNote de bas de page 7. L\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 de travailler le 24 septembre 2022. Il demande que les prestations commencent le dimanche de la semaine d\u2019arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Dans son cas, il a demand\u00e9 que les prestations commencent le 25 septembre 2022.\n[25] La politique de la Commission pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une personne doit pr\u00e9senter sa demande dans les 4 semaines civiles. Dans le cas de l\u2019appelant, la semaine commence lors de l\u2019arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration le 25 septembre 2022. Il pouvait donc pr\u00e9senter sa demande jusqu\u2019au 23 octobre 2022 sans avoir \u00e0 justifier son retard. L\u2019appelant a donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande dans la cinqui\u00e8me semaine. La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les prestations commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 cette dateNote de bas de page 8.\n[26] J\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant a un motif valable pour expliquer son retard \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande en tenant compte de la politique de la Commission. Je comprends que l\u2019appelant a agi le plus rapidement possible lorsqu\u2019il a eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un v\u00e9hicule. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019appelant r\u00e9side en r\u00e9gion, il vit seul et il n\u2019a pas acc\u00e8s au transport en commun.\n[27] Concernant la question de savoir si l\u2019appelant remplissait les conditions requises au moment de sa demande, je comprends que l\u2019appelant y r\u00e9pondait. En effet, la Commission a refus\u00e9 de verser des prestations \u00e0 partir du 25 septembre 2022 uniquement au motif que l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande en retard sans motif valable.\nConclusion [28] L\u2019appelant a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait un motif valable justifiant le retard de sa demande initiale de prestations pendant toute la p\u00e9riode \u00e9coul\u00e9e.\n[29] L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nL\u2019article 10 (4) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi utilise le terme \u00ab demande initiale \u00bb pour parler de la premi\u00e8re demande de prestations de la partie prestataire, qui sert \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la personne remplit les conditions requises pour \u00e9tablir une p\u00e9riode de prestations.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 10 (4) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Burke, 2012 CAF 139.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Burke, 2012 CAF 139.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir les d\u00e9cisions Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Somwaru, 2010 CAF 336 et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Kaler, 2011 CAF 266.\nNote de bas de page 6\nVoir les d\u00e9cisions Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Somwaru, 2010 CAF 336 et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Kaler, 2011 CAF 266.\nNote de bas de page 7\nGuide de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u2013 Chapitre 3 - Section 1\nNote de bas de page 8\nGD3-18\n",

Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas page 1.\nAper\u00e7u [3] Depuis le mois de juin 2022, l\u2019appelante travaille \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re pour un courtier en assurance. Le 25 juillet 2023, elle est cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[4] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9sente une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. La Commission enqu\u00eate aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019appelante et de l\u2019employeur pour connaitre les motifs du cong\u00e9diement. L\u2019employeur d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u trois plaintes au sujet de l\u2019appelante. Le 25 juillet 203, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rencontr\u00e9e et cong\u00e9di\u00e9e pour cette raison. La Commission refuse de verser des prestations \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, parce que l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi en raison de son inconduite.\n[5] L\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. L\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas fourni la preuve des plaintes. Il a pr\u00e9text\u00e9 que cela \u00e9tait confidentiel. Elle soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e sans motif. Elle a port\u00e9 plainte \u00e0 la Commission de normes, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la sant\u00e9 du travail (CNESST), parce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re que le cong\u00e9diement est ill\u00e9gal et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas commis les gestes reproch\u00e9s.\nQuestion que je dois examiner en premier [6] Lors de l\u2019audience, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelante a produit des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. \u00c9galement, l\u2019appelant a transmis des documents apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience dont l\u2019entente entre l\u2019appelante et son employeur intervenue devant la CNESST.\n[7] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience, les documents sont achemin\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission, afin qu\u2019elle puisse pr\u00e9senter des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires. J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai \u00e0 la CommissionNote de bas page 2. Elle n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la lettre. La d\u00e9cision peut donc \u00eatre rendue apr\u00e8s ce d\u00e9lai.\nQuestion en litige [8] L\u2019appelante a-t-elle perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite ?\nAnalyse [9] Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite, je dois d\u00e9cider deux choses. D\u2019abord, je dois d\u00e9cider pour quelle raison l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi. Ensuite, je dois d\u00e9cider si la loi consid\u00e8re cette raison comme une inconduite.\nPourquoi l\u2019appelante a-t-elle perdu son emploi ?Note de bas page 3 [10] L\u2019appelante travaille \u00e0 titre de conseill\u00e8re en finance pour un courtier en assurance. Elle obtient un cong\u00e9 du 11 f\u00e9vrier 2023 au 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023 pour visiter sa famille. Elle quitte le Canada pour l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[11] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023, elle doit consulter d\u2019urgence un m\u00e9decin, parce qu\u2019elle fait une h\u00e9morragie. Elle doit recevoir des soins en Alg\u00e9rie. Elle informe son employeur de la situation. Elle obtient l\u2019autorisation de son m\u00e9decin de revenir au Canada vers le 20 juillet 2023. Elle revient au Canada le 20 juillet 2023. Elle doit reprendre son emploi le 27 juillet 2023.\n[12] Le 24 juillet 2023, son employeur demande de la rencontrer par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence le 25 juillet 2023. L\u2019appelant suppose qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre mise au courant de certains changements pendant son absence.\n[13] Lors de la rencontre du 25 juillet 2023, l\u2019employeur est accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une repr\u00e9sentante d\u2019un de ses clients. Elles informent l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle est cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, parce qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u trois plaintes de la part d\u2019un assureur, d\u2019un conseiller et d\u2019un client.\n[14] L\u2019appelante demande des d\u00e9tails concernant ces plaintes. L\u2019employeur lui mentionne que le tout fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et confidentiel. On demande \u00e0 l\u2019appelante de signer une quittance pour mettre un terme \u00e0 l\u2019emploi. L\u2019appelante refuse.\n[15] Selon les informations recueillies par la Commission aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019employeur, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 le Code de d\u00e9ontologie de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers.\n[16] Dans le cadre de la demande de r\u00e9vision, l\u2019employeur confirme qu\u2019il y a re\u00e7u trois plaintes. Toutefois, il d\u00e9clare que la plainte de l\u2019assureur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas importante. Dans les faits, on reprochait \u00e0 l\u2019appelante d\u2019avoir des \u00e9critures illisibles. La plainte d\u2019un assureur courtier concerne la vente d\u2019une assurance. L\u2019appelante devait elle-m\u00eame demander l\u2019annulation de l\u2019assurance. Elle a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 au client de la faire. Enfin, la plainte d\u2019un client concernait des informations erron\u00e9es saisies par l\u2019appelante.\n[17] L\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. \u00c0 titre de conseill\u00e8re financi\u00e8re, elle doit respecter le Code de d\u00e9ontologie de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers. Elle n\u2019a eu aucune plainte en lien avec les gestes qui lui sont reproch\u00e9s.\n[18] Elle soutient que l\u2019employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et de son \u00e2ge.\n[19] Il est probable qu\u2019elle ait commis des erreurs en saisissant des donn\u00e9es, mais l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 les gestes reproch\u00e9s.\n[20] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le dossier, entendu le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelante et pris en compte les repr\u00e9sentations de parties, je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 les gestes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\n[21] Lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019inconduite, il faut se fonder sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve clairs et non de simples conjectures et hypoth\u00e8sesNote de bas page 4.\n[22] De plus, l\u2019inconduite est une violation de la loi, d\u2019un r\u00e8glement ou d\u2019une r\u00e8gle de d\u00e9ontologie et peut faire en sorte qu\u2019une condition essentielle \u00e0 l\u2019emploi cesse d\u2019\u00eatre satisfaiteNote de bas page 5. On doit examiner les faits. On ne peut pas non se contenter d\u2019adopter la conclusion de l\u2019employeur sur l\u2019inconduite. Il faut une appr\u00e9ciation objective permettant de dire que l\u2019inconduite avait vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de la perte de l\u2019emploiNote de bas page 6.\n[23] Or, la Commission n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a enfreint une r\u00e8gle, une loi ou un r\u00e8glement. L\u2019employeur a soutenu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles, sans en fournir la preuve \u00e0 la Commission. Il a simplement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des erreurs commises par l\u2019appelante, mais il n\u2019y avait rien \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions. Cong\u00e9dier une personne en raison d\u2019une inconduite est une chose grave qui entra\u00eene des r\u00e9percussions importantes. On ne peut pas se contenter d\u2019adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 la th\u00e8se de l\u2019employeur qui ne fournit pas une preuve claire.\n[24] D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019appelante a produit l\u2019entente intervenue entre son ancien employeur et elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une plainte pour pratique ill\u00e9gale de la part de l\u2019employeur.\n[25] Je comprends que je ne suis pas li\u00e9e par l\u2019entente intervenue entre l\u2019employeur et l\u2019appelanteNote de bas page 7. Je dois tout de m\u00eame examiner la preuve. J\u2019ai effectivement examin\u00e9 la preuve de la Commission et j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas prouv\u00e9 les gestes reproch\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\n[26] \u00c9galement, bien que les parties n\u2019aient fait aucune admission, l\u2019employeur ou son partenaire d\u2019affaires a tout de m\u00eame sign\u00e9 une lettre indiquant que l\u2019appelante a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi pour des raisons personnelles. Selon l\u2019attestation d\u2019emploi, l\u2019appelante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une assiduit\u00e9 sans faille, de l\u2019entregent et une bonne volont\u00e9 \u00e0 bien servir la client\u00e8leNote de bas page 8.\n[27] Cette lettre de l\u2019employeur est difficilement conciliable avec sa position prise pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission.Note de bas page 9\n[28] Dans ce contexte, j\u2019estime que la Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 les gestes qui ont amen\u00e9 le cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019appelante.\n[29] Je n\u2019ai pas besoin d\u2019examiner si les gestes commis par l\u2019appelante constituent de l\u2019inconduite, parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9s par la Commission.\nAlors, l\u2019appelante a-t-elle perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite ? [30] Selon mes conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\nConclusion [31] La Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. C\u2019est pourquoi l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[32] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nL\u2019article 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011emploi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une partie prestataire qui perd son emploi en raison de son inconduite est exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations.\nNote de bas de page 2\nLettre transmise le 24 janvier 2024 \u00e0 la Commission.

Elle devait reprendre son emploi le 20 avril 2020. Cependant, en raison de la pand\u00e9mie de la COVID-19, l\u2019employeur a repris ses activit\u00e9s le 21 mai 2020.\n[4] Au d\u00e9but de la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19, une nouvelle prestation appel\u00e9e \u00ab prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgenceNote de bas de page 1 \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e. Le montant vers\u00e9 dans le cadre de cette prestation \u00e9tait de 500 $ par semaineNote de bas de page 2. Cependant, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de verser quatre semaines de prestations \u00e0 l\u2019avance (2 000 $) aux personnes demandant les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence pour la premi\u00e8re fois.\n[5] L\u2019appelante pr\u00e9sente une demande pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence le 30 avril 2020.\n[6] La Commission \u00e9tablit une p\u00e9riode de prestations. Le 15 juin 2020, la Commission lui verse un montant de 2000 $.\n[7] Ayant repris son emploi le 21 mai 2020, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas rempli ses demandes pour recevoir des prestations. Elle croyait que le 2000 $ repr\u00e9sentait les 4 semaines de ch\u00f4mage.\n[8] Le 13 novembre 2021, la Commission r\u00e9clame l\u2019appelante de la somme de 2000 $. En fait, n\u2019ayant pas compl\u00e9t\u00e9 ses demandes de prestations, la Commission a conclu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019y avait pas droit.\nQuestion en litige [9] L\u2019appelante doit-elle rembourser l\u2019avance qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue sur les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence ?\nAnalyse [10] Du 15 mars au 3 octobre 2020, les prestataires pouvaient demander des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence pour deux semaines \u00e0 la foisNote de bas de page 3. La loi autorisait la Commission \u00e0 verser ces prestations avant la date o\u00f9 elles auraient normalement \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9esNote de bas de page 4.\n[11] L\u2019appelante travaille pour une pourvoirie. Elle devait reprendre son emploi le 20 avril 2020, mais la date est report\u00e9e en raison des mesures sanitaires mises sur pied pendant la pand\u00e9mie.\n[12] Elle pr\u00e9sente une demande pour recevoir des prestations. Une p\u00e9riode est \u00e9tablie \u00e0 partir du 20 avril 2020. L\u2019appelante reprend son emploi le 21 mai 2020.\n[13] Le 15 juin 2020, la Commission verse \u00e0 l\u2019appelante la somme de 2 000 $. Ce montant correspond \u00e0 quatre semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence. La Commission pr\u00e9voyait r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer cette avance en retenant quatre semaines de prestations plus tard, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aux 13e, 14e, 18e et 19e semaines de prestations demand\u00e9es.\n[14] La Commission r\u00e9clame les prestations vers\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019appelante, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas rempli ses demandes pour chaque semaine de ch\u00f4mage. La Commission a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelante qu\u2019elle devait remplir ses demandes pour avoir le droit de recevoir des prestations. Cependant, l\u2019appelante n\u2019a pas rempli ses demandes.\n[15] Pour sa part, l\u2019appelante explique qu\u2019elle ne savait pas qu\u2019elle avait le droit de recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence. Lorsqu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u son ch\u00e8que de 2000 $ au mois de juin 2020 pour ses quatre semaines de ch\u00f4mage. En fait, elle s\u2019est dit que sa demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e, puisque la Commission lui a vers\u00e9 4 semaines de prestations apr\u00e8s sa p\u00e9riode de ch\u00f4mage.\n[16] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le dossier et pris en compte les repr\u00e9sentations des parties, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante ne doit pas rembourser la somme de 2000 $ r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par la Commission. Pour en arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, j\u2019ai tenu compte des dispositions 153.7 (1) et 153.8 (1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi qui indiquent ce qui suit :\n153.7 (1) La prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence est \u00e0 verser au prestataire qui pr\u00e9sente une demande en vertu de l\u2019article 153.8 et qui y est admissible. (1,1) La Commission peut verser la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence au prestataire avant le moment normalement pr\u00e9vu pour le faire.\n153.8 (1) Tout prestataire peut, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u2014 notamment de forme \u2014 fix\u00e9es par le ministre, pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence pour toute p\u00e9riode, commen\u00e7ant un dimanche, de deux semaines comprises dans la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 15 mars 2020 et se terminant le 3 octobre 2020.\n[17] En effet, dans son interpr\u00e9tation \u00e0 g\u00e9om\u00e9trie variable, la Commission a soutenu devant la Division d\u2019appel de notre Tribunal qu\u2019elle pouvait fixer la forme pour pr\u00e9senter les demandes d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 5.\n[18] Ainsi, l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 4 semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence. Elle a re\u00e7u 4 semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Elle n\u2019a donc pas \u00e0 rembourser le 2000 $.\n[19] Le tableau ci-dessous permet de comprendre le calcul des prestations payables \u00e0 l\u2019appelante.\nSemaine Semaine d\u00e9butant Prestations pay\u00e9es R\u00e9mun\u00e9-ration Admissible 153.9(1) - 2 semaines A Admissible 153.9(4) - 4 semaines B Compteur de semaine Admissible avec A ou B\n1 19 avril, 2020 $ $ oui non\n500 $\n2 26 avril, 2020 $ $ oui non\n500 $\n3 3 mai, 2020 $ $ oui non\n500 $\n4 10 mai, 2020 $ $ oui non\n500 $\n5 17 mai, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n6 24 mai, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n7 31 mai, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n8 7 juin, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n9 14 juin, 2020 $2,000 $ non non\n$\n10 21 juin, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n11 28 juin, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n12 5 juillet, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n13 12 juillet, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n14 19 juillet, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n15 26 juillet, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n16 2 ao\u00fbt, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n17 9 ao\u00fbt, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n18 16 ao\u00fbt, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n19 23 ao\u00fbt, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n20 30 ao\u00fbt, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n21 6 septembre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n22 13 septembre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n23 20 septembre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n24 27 septembre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n25 4 octobre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n26 11 octobre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n27 18 octobre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\n28 25 octobre, 2020 $ $ non non\n$\nTotal pay\u00e9 2 000 $\nTotal de l'admissibilit\u00e9\n2 000 $\n[20] L\u2019appelante n\u2019a donc pas re\u00e7u trop de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 rembourser l\u2019avance de 2000 $.\nConclusion [21] L\u2019appelante ne doit pas rembourser la somme de 2000 $ re\u00e7ue \u00e0 titre de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence.\n[22] L\u2019appel est donc accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nLa partie VIII.4 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e9tablit les r\u00e8gles applicables \u00e0 la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 153.10 (1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir les articles 153.7 (1) et 153.8 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir l\u2019article 153.7 (1,1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 5\nGB c Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi, TSS AD-23-778 et LG c Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi TSS AD-23-895.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Le demandeur (prestataire) s\u2019est vu refuser les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res par la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible \u00e0 travailler. Elle a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur un certificat m\u00e9dical produit par le prestataire dont le diagnostic \u00e9tait inapte \u00e0 l\u2019emploi pour incapacit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 24 octobre 2022 \u00e0 juillet 2023. Le prestataire a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission mais celle-ci a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision. Il a interjet\u00e9 appel aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal.\n[3] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de la preuve que le prestataire \u00e9tait incapable de travailler et disponible \u00e0 travailler chaque jour au sens de la loi. Elle a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible \u00e0 travailler au sens de la loi.\nQuestion en litige [4] La loi sp\u00e9cifie les seuls moyens d\u2019appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ces erreurs r\u00e9visables sont que :\n1. Le processus d\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou encore, elle s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e sur une question sans pouvoir de le faire. 3. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. 4. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[5] La demande de permission d\u2019en appeler est une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire \u00e0 une audience sur le fond de l'affaire. C'est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape que le prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est ici inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui auquel il devra rencontrer \u00e0 l'audience de l'appel sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e0 prouver sa th\u00e8se mais, il doit \u00e9tablir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. En d\u2019autres mots, il doit \u00e9tablir que l\u2019on peut soutenir qu\u2019il y a eu erreur r\u00e9visable sur laquelle l\u2019appel peut r\u00e9ussir.\n[6] La permission d\u2019en appeler sera en effet accord\u00e9e si je suis convaincu qu\u2019au moins l\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel soulev\u00e9 par le prestataire conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas la permission de faire appel au prestataire [7] Le prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en ch\u00f4mage pour une p\u00e9riode de six mois. Il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au mois de juin 2023. Il soutient que le certificat m\u00e9dical est erron\u00e9 et inutile. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 admissible aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Il \u00e9tait disponible et capable de travailler chaque jour. Il soumet une liste qui contient ses recherches d\u2019emplois pendant la p\u00e9riode en litige.\n[8] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que je ne dois consid\u00e9rer que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de d\u00e9cider de la pr\u00e9sente demande. En effet, un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une nouvelle opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Les pouvoirs de la division d\u2019appel sont limit\u00e9s par la loi.Note de bas de page 1\n[9] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a re\u00e7u des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurances emploi \u00e0 partir du 24 octobre 2022. Le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de son employeur indiquait un manque de travail. Le prestataire a renouvel\u00e9 sa demande de prestation en avril 2023 en soumettant un certificat m\u00e9dical. Ce certificat indiquait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de travailler pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 24 octobre 2022 \u00e0 juillet 2023.\n[10] La Commission a r\u00e9\u00e9valu\u00e9 le dossier et converti les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res en prestations de maladie, entrainant ainsi un trop-per\u00e7u de 3 738 $.\n[11] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le maximum de semaine payable en vertu de la loi est de 15 semaines, les prestations maladie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es r\u00e9troactivement du 24 octobre 2022 au 6 f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[12] Le certificat m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 4 avril 2023 produit par le prestataire indique qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesures de retravailler depuis son hospitalisation de septembre 2022, et qu\u2019il est inapte \u00e0 l\u2019emploi pour incapacit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 24 octobre 2022 \u00e0 juillet 2023.\n[13] Devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le prestataire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesures d\u2019expliquer pourquoi son m\u00e9decin n\u2019a pas voulu modifier son certificat m\u00e9dical s\u2019il \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler.\n[14] De plus, le prestataire a initialement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas effectu\u00e9 une recherche d\u2019emploi.Note de bas de page 2\n[15] De la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire \u00e9tait incapable de travailler pendant la p\u00e9riode en litige et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait effectu\u00e9 aucune recherche active d\u2019emploi. Elle a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas capable et disponible \u00e0 travailler chaque jour au sens de la loi.\n[16] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique applicable en mati\u00e8re de disponibilit\u00e9. Elle a appliqu\u00e9 ce crit\u00e8re aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le prestataire \u00e9tait capable et disponible \u00e0 travailler.\n[17] Un appel devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une occasion pour le prestataire de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 nouveau sa position et d\u2019esp\u00e9rer un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent. Je constate que le prestataire ne soul\u00e8ve aucune question de droit ou de fait ou de comp\u00e9tence dont la r\u00e9ponse pourrait mener \u00e0 l\u2019annulation de la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e.\n[18] Apr\u00e8s examen du dossier d\u2019appel, de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et des arguments au soutien de la demande de permission d\u2019en appeler, je n\u2019ai d\u2019autres choix que de conclure que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nConclusion [19] La permission de faire appel n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nSibbald c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2022 CAF 157.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir GD3-34\n",

Ce dernier s\u2019est vu refuser les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res par la Commission d\u2019assurance-emploi puisqu\u2019il avait produit un certificat m\u00e9dical dont le diagnostic \u00e9tait inapte \u00e0 l\u2019emploi pour incapacit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 24 octobre 2022 \u00e0 juillet 2023.\nQuestion en litige [3] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait disponible et capable de travailler conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (la Loi).\nAnalyse [4] Selon l\u2019article 12 (3) (c) de la Loi, le nombre maximal de semaines de prestations payables dans le cas d\u2019une blessure ou d\u2019une maladie est de 15 semaines.\n[5] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurances emploi \u00e0 partir du 24 octobre 2022. Le relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de la X indiquait un manque de travail. L\u2019appelant a renouvel\u00e9 sa demande de prestation en avril 2023 en soumettant un certificat m\u00e9dical.

Il n\u2019y a aucune information qui atteste que vous auriez travaill\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode en litige ou que vous auriez fait une recherche d\u2019emploi au sens de la Loi. Au contraire, toutes les informations au dossier attestent que vous \u00e9tiez incapable de travailler, vous qualifiant ainsi pour des prestations de maladie.\n[13] Le Tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019un certificat m\u00e9dical avec un diagnostic attestant votre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9tablir des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res.\n[14] Le Tribunal ne rel\u00e8ve aucune information au dossier \u00e0 l\u2019effet que vous \u00e9tiez en recherche active d\u2019emploi ou disponible et capable de le faire chaque jour.\nConclusion [15] Consid\u00e9rant l\u2019ensemble des informations au dossier et les informations obtenues dans le cadre de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9}.",

Puis, chacune a demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. Cependant, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada (la Commission) a refus\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res \u00e0 toutes les prestataires parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas :\n\u00b7 prolonger la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence;\n\u00b7 prolonger la p\u00e9riode de prestations;\n\u00b7 verser des prestations pendant plus de 50 semaines, soit le maximum permis par la loi.\nLes prestataires ont fait appel des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

Les six intim\u00e9es (prestataires) ne sont pas admissibles \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nAper\u00e7u [2] Les prestataires ont touch\u00e9 des prestations parentales et de maternit\u00e9. Chacune d\u2019entre elles a subi une perte d\u2019emploi soit avant, pendant ou apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9 de travail. Puis, chacune a demand\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 1.\n[3] Cependant, la Commission a refus\u00e9 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res \u00e0 toutes les prestataires parce que la Commission ne pouvait pas :\nprolonger la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence; prolonger la p\u00e9riode de prestations; verser des prestations pendant plus de 50 semaines, soit le maximum permis par la loi.\n[4] Les prestataires ont fait appel des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission aupr\u00e8s de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\n[5] Les prestataires soutiennent que certains articles de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi \u2014 ceux qui emp\u00eachent la prolongation de la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou de la p\u00e9riode de prestations et qui limitent \u00e0 50 le nombre de semaines de prestations qu\u2019elles peuvent recevoir \u2014 ont une incidence disproportionn\u00e9e chez les femmesNote de bas de page 2. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, ces articles ont pour effet de restreindre ou de priver l\u2019acc\u00e8s des femmes \u00e0 une protection sociale fondamentale, soit les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi, lorsqu\u2019elles se trouvent en ch\u00f4mage aux alentours de l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un enfant.\n[6] Par cons\u00e9quent, les prestataires demandent que ces articles soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s discriminatoires et en violation du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (Charte).\n[7] Puisque les prestataires contestent plusieurs articles qui sont interreli\u00e9s, je me r\u00e9f\u00e8re parfois \u00e0 l\u2019effet global de ces articles comme la limite de 50 semainesNote de bas de page 3.\n[8] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une longue proc\u00e9dure, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a :\nconclu que les prestataires avaient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les articles contest\u00e9s violent le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Charte; conclu que la Commission n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que ces violations se justifient dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique; d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les articles contest\u00e9s de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e9taient inconstitutionnels; charg\u00e9 le gouvernement de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour permettre aux prestataires d\u2019obtenir des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi pour la perte de leur emploi.\n[9] La Commission a ensuite port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en appel aupr\u00e8s de la division d\u2019appel. Voici les raisons pour lesquelles j\u2019accueille l\u2019appel de la Commission.\nQuestions en litige [10] Ma d\u00e9cision aborde les questions suivantes :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur de droit en refusant de suivre des d\u00e9cisions de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale? b) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle viol\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle en joignant les appels et en ne r\u00e9digeant qu\u2019une seule d\u00e9cision? c) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle rendu une d\u00e9cision entach\u00e9e d\u2019erreurs de droit dans son analyse du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte? d) Dans l\u2019affirmative, quelle serait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de corriger l\u2019erreur de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nAnalyse [11] Je peux intervenir dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a viol\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle ou si sa d\u00e9cision est entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur de droitNote de bas de page 4.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures ne d\u00e9terminent pas l\u2019issue de ces appels [12] La Commission soutient que les questions constitutionnelles soulev\u00e9es par ces appels ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les affaires Sollbach et MillerNote de bas de page 5. De plus, la Commission affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit en refusant de suivre ces d\u00e9cisions.\n[13] Je rejette cet argument. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en examinant les questions soulev\u00e9es dans ces appels.\n[14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a reconnu qu\u2019elle peut r\u00e9examiner une question constitutionnelle dans les situations suivantes :\nune nouvelle question de droit se pose; il y a une modification importante de la situation ou de la preuveNote de bas de page 6.\n[15] Comme l\u2019a reconnu la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les deux situations existent dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[16] Premi\u00e8rement, les prestataires contestent ici de nombreuses dispositions diff\u00e9rentes, alors que Mme Sollbach et Mme Miller n\u2019en ont contest\u00e9 qu\u2019une seule. Deuxi\u00e8mement, depuis la parution des d\u00e9cisions Sollbach et Miller,d\u2019importants changements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et au cadre analytique qui s\u2019impose dans les cas touchant l\u2019article 15 de la CharteNote de bas de page 7. Et troisi\u00e8mement, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est plus compl\u00e8te par rapport \u00e0 la preuve dans les affaires Sollbach et Miller, qui est plut\u00f4t difficile \u00e0 cerner.\n[17] Concernant l\u2019affaire Miceli-Riggins, cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur des arguments diff\u00e9rents, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve diff\u00e9rents et un r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif diff\u00e9rent, soit le R\u00e9gime de pensions du CanadaNote de bas de page 8. La d\u00e9cision Miceli-Riggins ne devrait donc pas \u00eatre contraignante dans la situation qui nous occupe.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas viol\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle en joignant les appels et en ne r\u00e9digeant qu\u2019une seule d\u00e9cision [18] La Commission reproche \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019avoir refus\u00e9 de joindre les appels au d\u00e9but de sa proc\u00e9dure, puis de les avoir joints vers la fin, rendant une seule d\u00e9cision dans le cadre des six appelsNote de bas de page 9. Selon elle, la jonction des appels a entra\u00een\u00e9 les cons\u00e9quences suivantes :\nla division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019analyse contextuelle demand\u00e9e dans un dossier portant sur la Charte; elle n\u2019a pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la preuve et tenu compte de toutes les circonstances de chaque prestataire.\n[19] Je rejette les arguments de la Commission sur cette question.\n[20] Bien que je reconnaisse que la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait quelque peu inhabituelle, les plaintes de la Commission portent sur la qualit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision et non sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. La Commission ne pr\u00e9tend pas, par exemple, qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendue, de r\u00e9pondre aux arguments des autres parties ou de se d\u00e9fendre.\n[21] En effet, la Commission ne s\u2019est jamais oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la jonction des appels dans le pass\u00e9 et a souvent regroup\u00e9 ses observations dans un seul document.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans son analyse du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte [22] Le contexte est important lorsqu\u2019on examine des questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte. Je commencerai donc mon analyse par un aper\u00e7u du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi, afin de donner une id\u00e9e de sa complexit\u00e9 et de souligner un certain nombre de ses limites. J\u2019effectuerai \u00e9galement un survol du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini par les tribunaux en \u00e9tudiant l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\nLe r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi offre un soutien au revenu partiel et temporaire [23] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9 l\u2019historique et l\u2019objectif de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 10. La loi \u00e9tablit \u00ab un r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance sociale aux fins d\u2019indemniser les ch\u00f4meurs pour la perte de revenus provenant de leur emploi et [assure] leur s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique et sociale pendant un certain temps et les [aide] ainsi \u00e0 retourner sur le march\u00e9 du travailNote de bas de page 11. \u00bb\n[24] Le Parlement a apport\u00e9 de nombreuses modifications \u00e0 la loi au fil des ans. Ces modifications ont, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, assoupli les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, augment\u00e9 les prestations et \u00e9limin\u00e9 certaines injusticesNote de bas de page 12.\n[25] Parmi ces modifications, le Parlement a \u00e9largi le nombre de situations dans lesquelles une personne peut subir un arr\u00eat involontaire de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[26] Les prestations sp\u00e9ciales de l\u2019assurance-emploi offrent un soutien temporaire aux personnes assur\u00e9es qui ne peuvent pas travailler en raison de certains \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la vie, notamment d\u2019une maladie, d\u2019une grossesse ou de l\u2019obligation de s\u2019occuper d\u2019un nouveau-n\u00e9 ou d\u2019un enfant nouvellement adopt\u00e9Note de bas de page 13.\n[27] Il convient de souligner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments cl\u00e9s suivants du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi :\nLe r\u00e9gime n\u2019est pas universel. Les prestations sont seulement offertes aux personnes qui ont accumul\u00e9 un nombre minimum d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable pendant leur p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9renceNote de bas de page 14. Le r\u00e9gime offre un soutien au revenu partiel et temporaire. Il r\u00e9partit les risques li\u00e9s aux situations pr\u00e9vues par la loi entre toutes les personnes assur\u00e9es. Le r\u00e9gime est financ\u00e9 principalement par les cotisations per\u00e7ues aupr\u00e8s des employeurs et des travailleurs. La loi oblige la Commission \u00e0 fixer le taux de cotisation pour chaque ann\u00e9e en se fondant sur certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments. La Commission a comme but d\u2019atteindre un \u00e9quilibre financier, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 de rigoureux principes d\u2019assuranceNote de bas de page 15. Le r\u00e9gime n\u2019est pas un programme d\u2019aide sociale selon lequel les prestations sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9es en fonction des besoins de la personne qui les demande. Le montant et la dur\u00e9e des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi sont plut\u00f4t d\u00e9termin\u00e9s en fonction de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises. Le r\u00e9gime n\u2019est pas non plus un compte d\u2019\u00e9pargne. Le fait de cotiser au r\u00e9gime ne donne pas en soi le droit aux prestations. Les travailleurs sont oblig\u00e9s de payer des cotisations sur tous les gains assurables jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019un maximum annuel, et ce, m\u00eame si cette personne ne pr\u00e9voit pas toucher des prestationsNote de bas de page 16.\n[28] Depuis 2006, une entente f\u00e9d\u00e9rale-provinciale fait en sorte que les r\u00e9sidents du Qu\u00e9bec re\u00e7oivent des prestations de maternit\u00e9, parentales, d\u2019adoption et de paternit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019assurance parentale (RQAP) plut\u00f4t que les prestations semblables offertes aux termes de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 17.\n[29] Dans cette d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ignore largement le fait que les prestataires ont re\u00e7u leurs prestations parentales et de maternit\u00e9 du RQAP plut\u00f4t que du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Les deux r\u00e9gimes sont \u00e9troitement int\u00e9gr\u00e9s, et les prestataires n\u2019ont jamais soutenu que leur cas \u00e9tait sp\u00e9cifique aux femmes du Qu\u00e9bec. En effet, certaines prestataires ont re\u00e7u plus de prestations que si elles avaient v\u00e9cu ailleurs au CanadaNote de bas de page 18.\nLes prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, de maternit\u00e9 et parentales de l\u2019assurance-emploi [30] Bien que la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi offre d\u2019autres types de prestations, les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et les prestations sp\u00e9ciales, dont les prestations parentales et de maternit\u00e9, repr\u00e9sentent la vaste majorit\u00e9 des prestations vers\u00e9esNote de bas de page 19.\n[31] Les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi offrent un soutien allant de 14 \u00e0 45 semaines aux personnes assur\u00e9es qui ont perdu leur emploi sans en \u00eatre responsablesNote de bas de page 20. Pour \u00eatre admissibles \u00e0 ces prestations, les personnes doivent, entre autres, avoir accumul\u00e9 entre 420 et 700 heures d\u2019emploi assurable au cours de leur p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9renceNote de bas de page 21.\n[32] Les prestations de maternit\u00e9 et parentales comptent parmi les prestations sp\u00e9ciales offertes par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Une personne doit avoir accumul\u00e9 600 heures d\u2019emploi assurable pendant sa p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour \u00eatre admissible aux prestations sp\u00e9cialesNote de bas de page 22.\n[33] D\u2019une part, les m\u00e8res biologiques peuvent demander jusqu\u2019\u00e0 15 semaines de prestations de maternit\u00e9 pour soutenir leur r\u00e9tablissement physique et \u00e9motionnel. La loi pr\u00e9voit une certaine souplesse envers les m\u00e8res biologiques qui souhaitent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de cette prestation avant ou apr\u00e8s la naissance de leur enfant.\n[34] D\u2019autre part, les prestations parentales offrent encore plus de flexibilit\u00e9 aux parents, soit biologiques ou adoptifs, pour leur permettre de s\u2019occuper de leur nouvel enfant. Les prestations parentales peuvent \u00eatre touch\u00e9es par un seul parent ou partag\u00e9es parmi les parents. Dans ce dernier cas, les parents peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires de prestations.\n[35] De plus, les parents peuvent choisir de toucher des prestations parentales \u00e0 un taux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 pendant une p\u00e9riode plus courte (l\u2019option standard), ou \u00e0 un taux plus bas pendant une p\u00e9riode plus longue (l\u2019option prolong\u00e9e)Note de bas de page 23.\n[36] Bien que les prestations de maternit\u00e9 et parentales soutiennent les familles et permettent aux parents de s\u2019occuper de leur famille, l\u2019objectif et l\u2019effet premier de ces prestations se situent ailleurs. Il s\u2019agit avant tout de prestations de remplacement du revenu et celles-ci servent \u00e0 pr\u00e9server le rattachement d\u2019une personne au march\u00e9 du travailNote de bas de page 24.\n[37] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette conclusion, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a soulign\u00e9 que la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi n\u2019accorde aucun cong\u00e9 de travail. Les cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9 et parentales sont r\u00e9gis par d\u2019autres lois ou par des arrangements entre employeurs et employ\u00e9s.\nLe r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi est fond\u00e9 sur un lien entre la participation r\u00e9cente et active au march\u00e9 du travail et le versement des prestations [38] La Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit deux concepts importants qui ont pour effet d\u2019assurer un court laps de temps entre la participation active au march\u00e9 du travail et le versement des prestations : la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et la p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[39] La p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle une personne assur\u00e9e doit avoir accumul\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable pour recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Elle est calcul\u00e9e en utilisant la plus courte des p\u00e9riodes suivantes :\nla p\u00e9riode de 52 semaines qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de le d\u00e9but d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations; dans le cas o\u00f9 la personne assur\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli une p\u00e9riode de prestations, la p\u00e9riode qui d\u00e9bute en m\u00eame temps que la p\u00e9riode de prestations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et se termine \u00e0 la fin de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de prestations de la nouvelle demandeNote de bas de page 25.\n[40] Selon la deuxi\u00e8me situation, une personne ne peut jamais utiliser ses heures d\u2019emploi assurable plus d\u2019une fois. En outre, les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi ainsi que celles du RQAP ne constituent pas des heures d\u2019emploi assurable.\n[41] La p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence peut \u00eatre prolong\u00e9e dans certaines situations qui ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux prestataires dans cette affaireNote de bas de page 26.\n[42] La p\u00e9riode de prestations est la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle la Commission peut verser des prestations \u00e0 une personne assur\u00e9e. Elle est \u00e9tablie seulement si cette personne remplit les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. La date du d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode de prestations est \u00e9tablie en fonction de la date de l\u2019arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ou de la date de la demande, selon la situationNote de bas de page 27.\n[43] La p\u00e9riode de prestations compte normalement 52 semaines, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle soit prolong\u00e9e pour l\u2019une des raisons pr\u00e9vues par la loiNote de bas de page 28. Mais l\u00e0 encore, les prestataires ne remplissent pas les conditions requises pour la prolongation de leur p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[44] La Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement le concept d\u2019une p\u00e9riode d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations. Celle-ci veille \u00e0 ce que les prestations soient vers\u00e9es \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a provoqu\u00e9 le recours aux prestations. Par exemple, les prestations de maternit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre vers\u00e9es \u00e0 partir de 12 semaines avant la date pr\u00e9vue de l\u2019accouchement et cessent d\u2019\u00eatre payables au plus tard 17 semaines apr\u00e8s l\u2019accouchementNote de bas de page 29.\nLes prestations peuvent \u00eatre vers\u00e9es pendant un nombre maximal de semaines, mais peuvent \u00eatre combin\u00e9es dans certaines situations [45] Chaque type de prestations a ses propres limites, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire un nombre maximal de semaines pendant lesquelles la Commission peut verser les prestations au cours d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations. Par exemple, pendant une p\u00e9riode de prestations, une personne peut recevoir :\njusqu\u2019\u00e0 15 semaines de prestations de maternit\u00e9; jusqu\u2019\u00e0 35 semaines de prestations parentales (selon l\u2019option standard); de 14 \u00e0 45 semaines de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, normalement calcul\u00e9es en fonction du taux r\u00e9gional de ch\u00f4mage et du nombre d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable accumul\u00e9es au cours de la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9renceNote de bas de page 30.\n[46] Une personne peut \u00eatre admissible \u00e0 plus d\u2019un type de prestations \u00e0 la fois. Toutefois, elle peut b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un seul type de prestations \u00e0 la fois.\n[47] Si une personne remplit tous les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, elle peut combiner des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et sp\u00e9ciales \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations de 52 semaines, pour un maximum de 50 semaines de prestationsNote de bas de page 31. La contestation constitutionnelle des prestataires porte sur cette limite de 50 semaines.\n[48] Les dispositions de la loi qui permettent la combinaison de prestations sp\u00e9ciales sont complexesNote de bas de page 32. Cependant, on peut parfois combiner des prestations sp\u00e9ciales, ce qui a pour effet de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de prestations au-del\u00e0 de 52 semainesNote de bas de page 33. Si les conditions pertinentes sont remplies, une personne assur\u00e9e a donc la possibilit\u00e9 de recevoir toutes les semaines de prestations sp\u00e9ciales auxquelles elle a droit pendant une p\u00e9riode de prestations qui peut s\u2019\u00e9lever \u00e0 104 semaines.\nL\u2019article 15 de la Charte garantit l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00ab r\u00e9elle \u00bb [49] L\u2019article 15(1) de la Charte pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n15. (1) La loi ne fait acception de personne et s\u2019applique \u00e9galement \u00e0 tous, et tous ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame protection et au m\u00eame b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la loi, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute discrimination, notamment des discriminations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, le sexe, l\u2019\u00e2ge ou les d\u00e9ficiences mentales ou physiques.\n[50] Pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il y a une violation de l\u2019article 15, les prestataires doivent d\u00e9montrer, \u00e0 la fois, que les articles contest\u00e9s :\ncr\u00e9ent, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue ou en raison de leur effet, une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 ou analogue; imposent un fardeau ou nient un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantageNote de bas de page 34.\n[51] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada nous enseigne que la discrimination peut \u00eatre directe ou indirecte. En d\u2019autres mots, une loi qui para\u00eet neutre peut \u00eatre discriminatoire si elle a des effets disproportionn\u00e9s sur un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Il s\u2019agit de la discrimination par effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[52] Je tiens aussi \u00e0 souligner que l\u2019article 15 prot\u00e8ge le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 sur la base du sexe. Cependant, les arguments des prestataires ne s\u2019appliquent pas \u00e0 toutes les femmes. Leurs arguments s\u2019appliquent plut\u00f4t aux femmes qui ont perdu leur emploi sans en \u00eatre responsables, et ce, peu de temps avant ou apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e d\u2019un nouvel enfant.\n[53] N\u00e9anmoins, la Cour supr\u00eame confirme que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination parentale peuvent souvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sous forme de plaintes de discrimination par suite d\u2019un effet pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9e sur le sexeNote de bas de page 35.\n[54] Ayant expos\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments importants du contexte, je proc\u00e9derai maintenant \u00e0 mon analyse de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur en concluant que les articles contest\u00e9s cr\u00e9ent, en raison de leur effet, une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 [55] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la situation de chacune des prestataires est l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente. Cependant, je ne vois pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de mettre en \u00e9vidence toutes ces diff\u00e9rences. D\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre, les prestataires affirment que les articles contest\u00e9s ont limit\u00e9 leur acc\u00e8s aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[56] Aux fins de cette d\u00e9cision, j\u2019accepte que les prestataires aient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les articles contest\u00e9s cr\u00e9ent, en raison de leur effet, une distinction fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[57] Deux types d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour prouver qu\u2019une loi a un effet disproportionn\u00e9 sur les membres d\u2019un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 : des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur la situation du groupe de prestataires et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments sur les cons\u00e9quences pratiques de la loiNote de bas de page 36.\n[58] \u00c0 ce sujet, je souligne surtout les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les prestataires, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s par la Commission et qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 37 :\nLe partage in\u00e9gal des t\u00e2ches domestiques continue d\u2019\u00eatre la cause principale du fait que les femmes participent moins souvent au march\u00e9 du travail que les hommes et effectuent moins d\u2019heures de travail en moyenne. En 2015, les femmes ayant un enfant de moins de 18 ans effectuaient 60 % des travaux domestiques, dont 65 % des soins aux enfants. Elles n\u2019effectuaient que 39 % du travail r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9. De plus, la \u00ab p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 r\u00e9sultant de la maternit\u00e9 \u00bb dure au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019ann\u00e9e de naissance d\u2019un enfant. Les femmes subissent une baisse de revenu de plus de 40 % durant la p\u00e9riode p\u00e9rinatale, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 les femmes re\u00e7oivent un suppl\u00e9ment de l\u2019employeur ou d\u2019une autre source. De plus, cet effet perdure m\u00eame 9 ans apr\u00e8s la naissance de l\u2019enfantNote de bas de page 38. Les femmes risquent encore d\u2019\u00eatre en ch\u00f4mage apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 parental, malgr\u00e9 les dispositions de lois provinciales et f\u00e9d\u00e9rales visant leur protectionNote de bas de page 39; Les femmes utilisent 94,1 % des semaines de prestations de maternit\u00e9 et parentales et 58,8 % des autres prestations sp\u00e9cialesNote de bas de page 40; Un nombre important de nouvelles m\u00e8res sont donc touch\u00e9es par la limite de 50 semaines, alors que le nombre d\u2019hommes touch\u00e9s est tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9Note de bas de page 41.\n[59] En effet, les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le cas pr\u00e9sent ressemblent \u00e0 ceux que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a examin\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire FraserNote de bas de page 42.\n[60] Aux fins de cette d\u00e9cision, je suis donc dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter que les femmes ayant des enfants aient moins de chances que les autres personnes assur\u00e9es de pouvoir acc\u00e9der aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi et d\u2019\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es contre le risque d\u2019une perte d\u2019emploi.\n[61] Cependant, toutes les distinctions ne sont pas discriminatoires. Cette question fait l\u2019objet de la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l\u2019analyse dans les affaires relevant de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit en concluant que les articles contest\u00e9s imposent un fardeau ou nient un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage [62] Je suis sensible \u00e0 la situation des prestataires et je reconnais que la r\u00e8gle de 50 semaines leur a caus\u00e9 des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que cette r\u00e8gle a pour effet de maintenir les femmes dans la pauvret\u00e9 et dans un lien de d\u00e9pendance, et de consid\u00e9rer le salaire des femmes comme moins digne de protectionNote de bas de page 43.\n[63] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e fortement sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire FraserNote de bas de page 44. Elle a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision comme lui permettant de minimiser l\u2019importance du contexte l\u00e9gislatif dans le cadre de son analyse.\n[64] \u00c0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Cour supr\u00eame a lev\u00e9 toute incertitude sur cette question dans l\u2019affaire Sharma :le contexte l\u00e9gislatif est un facteur important que les tribunaux doivent examiner lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9valuent si une distinction constitue de la discrimination au sens de la CharteNote de bas de page 45. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour a soulign\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui doivent \u00eatre pris en compte lors de l\u2019\u00e9valuation du contexte l\u00e9gislatif :\nParmi les facteurs pertinents, mentionnons : les objets du r\u00e9gime, la question de savoir si la politique est con\u00e7ue dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de divers groupes, l\u2019affectation des ressources, les objectifs d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public particuliers vis\u00e9s par le l\u00e9gislateur et la question de savoir si les limites pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e9gime tiennent compte de ces facteursNote de bas de page 46 [\u2026]\n[65] J\u2019estime alors que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit dans son analyse du contexte global de cette situation, car elle n\u2019a pas tenu compte de l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi et de son contexte l\u00e9gislatif. Cette partie de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est plut\u00f4t ax\u00e9e sur le t\u00e9moignage des prestataires et leur rapport d\u2019expertNote de bas de page 47.\n[66] Lorsqu\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019ensemble du contexte, les articles contest\u00e9s ne sont pas arbitraires et ne nient pas un avantage d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage.\n[67] D\u2019abord, l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime n\u2019est pas de soutenir les familles. Il ne s\u2019agit pas non plus d\u2019une prestation universelle vers\u00e9e \u00e0 toutes les personnes qui en ont besoin.\n[68] Avant tout, le r\u00e9gime fournit des prestations de remplacement du revenu et pr\u00e9serve le rattachement du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire au march\u00e9 du travailNote de bas de page 48. Ce soutien au revenu est de nature partielle et temporaire. De plus, comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, le r\u00e9gime est fond\u00e9 sur un lien entre la participation r\u00e9cente et active au march\u00e9 du travail et le versement des prestations.\n[69] Il est \u00e9vident que les prestations de maternit\u00e9 et parentales sont conformes aux objets de la loi : elles r\u00e9duisent les effets d\u2019un arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et favorisent le rattachement au march\u00e9 du travail. La question de savoir s\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder des prestations suppl\u00e9mentaires aux personnes vuln\u00e9rables ou d\u00e9munies d\u00e9passe les objets de la loi et les comp\u00e9tences du Tribunal.\n[70] Le r\u00e9gime est \u00e9galement con\u00e7u dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de divers groupes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour les personnes qui ont subi un arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et ce, pour diff\u00e9rentes raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par la loi.\n[71] J\u2019ai expos\u00e9 certaines des complexit\u00e9s incorpor\u00e9es dans la conception de ce r\u00e9gime dans les paragraphes ci-dessus. Le r\u00e9gime est con\u00e7u pour r\u00e9pondre aux int\u00e9r\u00eats divergents de diff\u00e9rents groupes. Ce r\u00e9gime doit n\u00e9cessairement avoir des limites g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour combler les diff\u00e9rents besoins des personnes assur\u00e9esNote de bas de page 49. La limite de 50 semaines compte parmi ces limites g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\n[72] Par ailleurs, la limite de 50 semaines concerne l\u2019affectation des ressources. Les limites pr\u00e9vues par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi sont essentielles au bon fonctionnement et \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime, comme elles le sont pour tout autre r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance. Elles sont importantes pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019ampleur du risque assum\u00e9. Modifier ces limites pourrait avoir un effet sur l\u2019\u00e9quilibre financier que la Commission recherche et pourrait entra\u00eener une augmentation des taux de cotisation.\n[73] Bien que les prestataires ne soient pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 cette ligne a \u00e9t\u00e9 trac\u00e9e, elles ne contestent pas la valeur du r\u00e9gime ni la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de fixer des limites. En effet, pour assurer le bien-\u00eatre du r\u00e9gime, celui-ci doit atteindre un \u00e9quilibre financier et le taux de cotisation doit \u00eatre maintenu \u00e0 un niveau peu \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[74] Je reconnais qu\u2019une femme qui touche 15 semaines de prestations de maternit\u00e9 est, en effet, limit\u00e9e \u00e0 35 semaines de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. Cependant, le besoin essentiel de fixer des limites dans un r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance aussi complexe m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que la limite de 50 semaines n\u2019est pas arbitraire et qu\u2019elle n\u2019aura pas l\u2019effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ou des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9sNote de bas de page 50.\n[75] Les prestataires se sont vu refuser des prestations, mais pas parce que leurs salaires sont moins dignes de protection. Comme beaucoup d\u2019autres personnes, elles ont tout simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019une des nombreuses limites pr\u00e9vues par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 51.\n[76] La limite de 50 semaines n\u2019en est qu\u2019une parmi de nombreuses limites impos\u00e9es par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Son application n\u2019est pas limit\u00e9e aux personnes qui veulent combiner les prestations de maternit\u00e9, parentales et r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Cette limite s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute personne qui veut combiner des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res avec tout autre type de prestations sp\u00e9cialesNote de bas de page 52. D\u2019ailleurs, m\u00eame les personnes qui veulent combiner diff\u00e9rents types de prestations sp\u00e9ciales peuvent faire face \u00e0 des limitesNote de bas de page 53.\n[77] Bien que j\u2019aie not\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que la pr\u00e9sente affaire ressemblait \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Fraser, une diff\u00e9rence importante se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 cette deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse.\n[78] Les demanderesses dans l\u2019affaire Fraser ont travaill\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019un partage de poste, ce qui les a amen\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler moins d\u2019heures et a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur leurs pensions de retraite.\n[79] Cependant, d\u2019autres personnes travaillant des heures r\u00e9duites avaient la possibilit\u00e9 de racheter des p\u00e9riodes de service \u00e0 temps plein ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Cette possibilit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e aux personnes \u2014 presque exclusivement des femmes \u2014 participant au programme de partage de poste.\n[80] L\u2019affaire qui nous pr\u00e9occupe est de nature diff\u00e9rente, car toute personne qui veut combiner les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et sp\u00e9ciales est assujettie \u00e0 la m\u00eame limite de 50 semaines.\n[81] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la limite de 50 semaines ne cr\u00e9e et ne renforce aucun st\u00e9r\u00e9otype selon lequel les femmes ne sont pas des atouts importants pour le march\u00e9 du travail. De plus, elle ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des femmes en donnant \u00e0 penser que leur travail ne m\u00e9rite pas autant de reconnaissance. Toute personne ayant droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi sera confront\u00e9e \u00e0 diverses limites fix\u00e9es par ce r\u00e9gime qui est \u00e0 la fois complexe et \u00e9troitement cibl\u00e9.\nLes prestataires ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime [82] L\u2019argument des prestataires repose sur un manque d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi. Toutefois, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime, m\u00eame si une personne peut avoir droit \u00e0 des prestations en fonction de diff\u00e9rentes raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 son arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[83] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit au paragraphe 222 de sa d\u00e9cision quand elle a constat\u00e9 que les femmes qui re\u00e7oivent des prestations parentales et de maternit\u00e9 et qui perdent leur emploi sont exclues du r\u00e9gime.\n[84] Au contraire, ces femmes ont b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 du r\u00e9gime jusqu\u2019au maximum offert aux termes de la loi.\n[85] Le r\u00e9gime fournit un soutien temporaire en cas d\u2019arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour une raison prescrite. Ici, les prestataires ont subi un arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour une raison prescrite, et la Commission leur a vers\u00e9 des prestations en cons\u00e9quence.\n[86] En effet, l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable invoqu\u00e9 par les prestataires doit se produire assez rarement. Elle ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 toutes les femmes, m\u00eame pas \u00e0 toutes les femmes avec un enfant.\n[87] Le probl\u00e8me auquel les prestataires sont confront\u00e9es est li\u00e9 au fait que leur arr\u00eat de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 pour une autre raison prescrite (la perte d\u2019un emploi), et ce, dans un court laps de temps.\n[88] Cependant, la Commission ne peut jamais verser plus d\u2019un type de prestations \u00e0 la fois. De plus, une personne peut atteindre la limite de 50 semaines dans divers sc\u00e9narios.\n[89] Imaginons, par exemple, une personne qui perd son emploi alors qu\u2019elle s\u2019occupe d\u2019un enfant gravement malade ou alors qu\u2019elle est incapable de travailler en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9. M\u00eame les femmes qui n\u2019accumulent pas suffisamment d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable entre deux grossesses se feront refuser des prestations pour la deuxi\u00e8me grossesse parce qu\u2019elles ne remplissent pas les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9Note de bas de page 54.\n[90] En effet, lorsque des personnes appartenant \u00e0 un groupe prot\u00e9g\u00e9 sont confront\u00e9es \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me, elles pourraient \u00e9galement pr\u00e9senter des contestations constitutionnelles afin de supprimer encore plus de limites fix\u00e9es par la loi. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lanc\u00e9 une mise en garde contre cette situationNote de bas de page 55.\n[91] Vu sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, le probl\u00e8me auquel les prestataires font face tient en partie au fait que la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi a am\u00e9lior\u00e9 la protection offerte aux femmes enceintes en bonifiant la dur\u00e9e des prestations de maternit\u00e9 et parentales jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la limite de 50 semaines.\n[92] Les prestataires seraient d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es si les prestations parentales \u00e9taient r\u00e9duites \u00e0 15 semaines, m\u00eame si cela leur donnait une meilleure protection en cas de ch\u00f4mage.\nLes r\u00e9gimes de prestations sont difficiles \u00e0 invalider sur le fondement de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte [93] Bien que la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi ne soit pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen fond\u00e9 sur la Charte, les contestations du r\u00e9gime fond\u00e9es sur le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 ont eu peu de succ\u00e8sNote de bas de page 56. Il en va de m\u00eame pour le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, qui est un r\u00e9gime contributif similaireNote de bas de page 57.\n[94] Les propos de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019affaire Gosselin sont aptes :\nPremi\u00e8rement, il est possible de conclure qu\u2019une disposition contest\u00e9e ne viole pas la Charte canadienne m\u00eame en l\u2019absence de correspondance parfaite entre un r\u00e9gime de prestations et les besoins ou la situation du groupe demandeur. On peut \u00e9prouver de la sympathie pour les personnes qui, pour une raison ou une autre, n\u2019ont peut\u2011\u00eatre pas pu participer aux programmes. Cependant, le fait qu\u2019un programme social donn\u00e9 ne r\u00e9ponde pas aux besoins de tous, sans exception, ne nous permet pas de conclure que ce programme ne correspond pas aux besoins et \u00e0 la situation v\u00e9ritables du groupe concern\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 le juge Iacobucci dans Law, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par. 105, nous ne devrions pas exiger \u00ab qu\u2019une loi doi[ve] toujours correspondre parfaitement \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sociale pour \u00eatre conforme au par. 15(1) de la Charte \u00bb. L\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un r\u00e9gime d\u2019aide sociale destin\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des jeunes adultes est un probl\u00e8me complexe, auquel il n\u2019existe pas de solution parfaite. Quelles que soient les mesures adopt\u00e9es par le gouvernement, il existera toujours un certain nombre de personnes auxquelles un autre ensemble de mesures aurait mieux convenu. Le fait que certaines personnes soient victimes des lacunes d\u2019un programme ne prouve pas que la mesure l\u00e9gislative en cause ne tient pas compte de l\u2019ensemble des besoins et de la situation du groupe de personnes touch\u00e9, ni que la distinction \u00e9tablie par cette mesure cr\u00e9e une discrimination r\u00e9elle au sens du par. 15(1)Note de bas de page 58.\n[95] En bref, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 sociale est complexe. Bien qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance sociale tel que la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi peut tenter de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de diverses personnes, on ne peut pas s\u2019attendre \u00e0 la perfection. On ne peut pas l\u2019exiger non plus en utilisant les protections de la Charte en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n[96] Je comprends parfaitement pourquoi les prestataires souhaitent disposer d\u2019une p\u00e9riode pour se consacrer exclusivement \u00e0 leur nouvel enfant, et avoir ensuite le temps de chercher un nouvel emploi. Cependant, j\u2019estime que le choix de leur accorder des prestations suppl\u00e9mentaires appartient au Parlement et non aux tribunaux. Ce premier est plus en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer les r\u00e9percussions provoqu\u00e9es par la modification d\u2019une limite importante sur un r\u00e9gime complexe comme l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[97] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 cette id\u00e9e de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res, dont celle\u2011ci :\nLorsque la Cour examine un argument qui veut qu\u2019un r\u00e9gime complexe de prestations pr\u00e9vu par la loi, comme celui de l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage, a un effet n\u00e9gatif diff\u00e9rentiel sur certains demandeurs contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 15, elle ne peut se pr\u00e9occuper de la question de savoir s\u2019il serait d\u00e9sirable d\u2019accorder des prestations \u00e9tendues comme on le recherche. Dans la cr\u00e9ation des programmes sociaux, il faut \u00e9tablir des priorit\u00e9s. Le l\u00e9gislateur est mieux \u00e9quip\u00e9 pour cette t\u00e2che que les tribunaux et la Constitution n\u2019exige pas que les tribunaux proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 un r\u00e9glage minutieux des r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifsNote de bas de page 59.\nJe vais rendre la d\u00e9cision que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre [98] Les erreurs de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale me permettent de rendre la d\u00e9cision que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendreNote de bas de page 60. Les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la r\u00e9paration la plus appropri\u00e9e dans le cas pr\u00e9sent.\n[99] Je suis d\u2019accord. Les faits de l\u2019affaire ne sont pas vraiment contest\u00e9s. De plus, les parties n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 emp\u00each\u00e9es de plaider leur cause devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit. Le dossier d\u2019appel est complet.\n[100] Cela signifie que je peux juger si les articles contest\u00e9s sont constitutionnels et si les prestataires ont droit \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nLes articles contest\u00e9s sont constitutionnels [101] Il ressort de l\u2019analyse ci-dessus que les prestataires n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli que les articles 8(2), 8(5), 10(2), 10(8)(a), 10(10) et 12(6) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi violent le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la Charte. Les articles contest\u00e9s sont constitutionnels. Par cons\u00e9quent, les prestataires sont confront\u00e9es \u00e0 la limite de 50 semaines et ne sont pas admissibles \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nConclusion [102] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel de la Commission. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit en concluant que les articles contest\u00e9s nient un avantage aux prestataires d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui a pour effet de renforcer, de perp\u00e9tuer ou d\u2019accentuer le d\u00e9savantage. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas suffisamment tenu compte de l\u2019objet du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi et de son contexte l\u00e9gislatif.\n[103] Cette erreur me permet de rendre la d\u00e9cision que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre. J\u2019estime que les articles contest\u00e9s sont constitutionnels. Les prestataires n\u2019ont donc pas droit \u00e0 des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi suppl\u00e9mentaires.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCes prestations sont offertes en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 2\nPlus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019appel vise les articles 8(2), 8(5), 10(2), 10(8)(a), 10(10) et 12(6) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 3\nJe reconnais que certaines prestataires ont re\u00e7u plus de 50 semaines de prestations en raison des dispositions du R\u00e9gime qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019assurance parentale qui sont plus avantageuses \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards : voir la situation de V. D. dans le dossier d\u2019appel AD\u201122\u201195. Ce qui est important, cependant, c\u2019est que toutes les prestataires se sont vu refuser des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi en raison des prestations parentales et de maternit\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ues.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir les articles 58(1)(a) et 58(1)(b) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.

Le Tribunal est d\u2019accord avec l\u2019appelantNote de bas de page 1.\n[2] La Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire parce qu\u2019il a fait quelque chose qui lui a fait perdre son emploi). Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 2.\nAper\u00e7u [3] L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de son emploi. Son employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 de signer deux des politiques de l\u2019employeur.\n[4] Bien que l\u2019appelant ne conteste pas ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9, il affirme que ce n\u2019est pas la vraie raison pour laquelle l\u2019employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9. L\u2019appelant explique que l\u2019employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce que, quelques semaines apr\u00e8s la confrontation qu\u2019il a eue avec son patron, celui-ci a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant devait signer une nouvelle politique et une politique d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place. Avant que la confrontation ne survienne, son patron consid\u00e9rait la signature de l\u2019appelant sur son contrat de travail comme une attestation des politiques.\n[5] La Commission a accept\u00e9 la raison du cong\u00e9diement que l\u2019employeur a fournie. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Elle l\u2019a donc exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\nQuestions que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9es en premier Le dossier d\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [6] L\u2019appelant a d\u2019abord fait appel de la d\u00e9cision dans laquelle on lui refuse des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal en mars 2023. La membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel, car elle a conclu que l\u2019appelant savait qu\u2019il serait probablement cong\u00e9di\u00e9 s\u2019il ne signait pas les documents et que son refus de signer les documents \u00e9tait intentionnel, conscient et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Autrement dit, l\u2019appelant avait perdu son emploi en raison de sa propre inconduite.\n[7] L\u2019appelant a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal. La division d\u2019appel a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de la conduite de l\u2019employeur ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019\u00ab inconduite \u00bb de l\u2019appelant pour bien \u00e9valuer si sa conduite \u00e9tait intentionnelle ou nonNote de bas de page 3. La division d\u2019appel a ordonn\u00e9 le renvoi du dossier d\u2019appel \u00e0 une ou un autre membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal pour r\u00e9examen. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision r\u00e9sulte de la deuxi\u00e8me audience.\nL\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e [8] L\u2019audience \u00e9tait initialement pr\u00e9vue le 30 novembre 2023. Avant cette audience, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une copie du compte rendu du r\u00e8glement qu\u2019il a conclu avec son employeur. Il a dit que, dans le cadre de ce r\u00e8glement, l\u2019employeur a convenu qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans motif et il a \u00e9mis un nouveau relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi qui le d\u00e9montrait. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 au personnel de Service Canada, qui a convenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas commis d\u2019inconduite.\n[9] J\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant les options qui s\u2019offraient \u00e0 lui : il pouvait choisir de retirer son appel \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations faites par le personnel de Service Canada, ou je pouvais demander \u00e0 la Commission de se prononcer sur la question de savoir si le compte rendu changeait sa position. L\u2019appelant a choisi la deuxi\u00e8me option et, si la position de la Commission ne changeait pas, l\u2019audience se poursuivrait le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2023. La Commission n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 sa position, donc l\u2019audience s\u2019est poursuivie comme pr\u00e9vu le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2023.\nL\u2019employeur n\u2019est pas une partie mise en cause \u00e0 l\u2019appel [10] Parfois, le Tribunal envoie une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019ancien employeur de la partie appelante pour lui demander s\u2019il souhaite \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme partie mise en cause \u00e0 l\u2019appel. C\u2019est ce que le Tribunal a fait dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Toutefois, l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre.\n[11] Pour \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme partie mise en cause, l\u2019employeur doit avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct dans l\u2019appel. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas ajouter l\u2019employeur comme partie mise en cause dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, car rien dans le dossier n\u2019indique que ma d\u00e9cision imposerait des obligations l\u00e9gales \u00e0 l\u2019employeur.\nLe compte rendu du r\u00e8glement [12] Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, avant qu\u2019une entente de r\u00e8glement puisse \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e pour r\u00e9futer une conclusion ant\u00e9rieure de la Commission, il doit y avoir une preuve quelconque qui neutraliserait la position prise par l\u2019employeur pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la CommissionNote de bas de page 4.\n[13] Rien ne prouve que l\u2019employeur a chang\u00e9 les raisons pour lesquelles il a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 l\u2019appelant. Par cons\u00e9quent, et compte tenu de mes conclusions selon lesquelles la Commission ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver qu\u2019il y a eu inconduite, je n\u2019ai pas pris en consid\u00e9ration le compte rendu pour rendre ma d\u00e9cision.\nQuestion en litige [14] L\u2019appelant a-t-il perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite?\nAnalyse [15] Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite, je dois examiner deux choses. D\u2019abord, je dois d\u00e9cider pour quelle raison l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi. Ensuite, je dois d\u00e9cider si la loi consid\u00e8re cette raison comme une inconduite.\nPourquoi l\u2019appelant a-t-il perdu son emploi? [16] Je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi parce qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de signer les politiques que son employeur lui a demand\u00e9 de signer.\n[17] L\u2019appelant et la Commission ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi. La Commission affirme que la raison fournie par l\u2019employeur est la v\u00e9ritable raison du cong\u00e9diement. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019employeur a dit \u00e0 la Commission que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 de signer des documents de l\u2019employeur, ce qui \u00e9tait une condition de son emploi. Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n\u2019est pas le comportement de l\u2019appelant ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 la mesure disciplinaire qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement, mais plut\u00f4t son refus de signer les documents requis apr\u00e8s que la mesure disciplinaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e.\n[18] L\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord. Il affirme que la v\u00e9ritable raison pour laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de son emploi est que, quelques semaines avant son cong\u00e9diement, son patron s\u2019est disput\u00e9 avec lui devant un autre employ\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait sous la supervision de l\u2019appelant. Plus tard, le patron s\u2019est excus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant, mais il lui a ensuite demand\u00e9 de signer un avertissement verbal. L\u2019avertissement disait que l\u2019appelant avait eu une conduite inacceptable, qu\u2019il avait adopt\u00e9 une approche conflictuelle avec son patron, qu\u2019il avait agi de fa\u00e7on non professionnelle, et qu\u2019il devait aussi signer deux politiques de l\u2019employeur. L\u2019appelant a refus\u00e9 de signer la lettre parce qu\u2019elle ne refl\u00e9tait pas ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement pass\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement refus\u00e9 de signer les politiques, car son employeur avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 convenu que la signature de son contrat de travail initial \u00e9tait une attestation satisfaisante des politiques de l\u2019employeur.\n[19] La lettre de cong\u00e9diement envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appelant indiquait que des mesures s\u2019imposaient parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas sign\u00e9 les politiques, les proc\u00e9dures et le guide de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Pour cette raison, l\u2019employeur a \u00e9tabli que les conditions de la relation d\u2019emploi avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement viol\u00e9es.\n[20] Je crois que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de signer les politiques, comme l\u2019avait demand\u00e9 son employeur. La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de signer les politiques et qu\u2019il a dit \u00e0 son employeur qu\u2019il ne le ferait pas.\nLa raison du cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019appelant est-elle une inconduite selon la loi? [21] Selon la loi, la raison du cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas une inconduite.\n[22] Pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduite au sens de la loi, la conduite doit \u00eatre d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle est consciente, voulue ou intentionnelleNote de bas de page 5. Une inconduite comprend \u00e9galement une conduite qui est tellement insouciante qu\u2019elle est presque d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9eNote de bas de page 6. Pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduite au sens de la loi, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l\u2019appelant ait eu une intention coupable (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il a voulu faire quelque chose de mal)Note de bas de page 7.\n[23] Il y a inconduite si l\u2019appelant savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que sa conduite pouvait l\u2019emp\u00eacher de remplir ses obligations envers son employeur et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement possible qu\u2019il soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour cette raisonNote de bas de page 8.\n[24] La Commission doit prouver que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison de son inconduite. La Commission doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduiteNote de bas de page 9.\n[25] Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019inconduite pouvait mener \u00e0 un cong\u00e9diement, il faut \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre l\u2019inconduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie prestataire et son emploiNote de bas de page 10.\n[26] La Commission affirme qu\u2019il y a eu inconduite parce que l\u2019appelant savait que s\u2019il ne signait pas les politiques de l\u2019entreprise, il serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Elle ajoute que l\u2019appelant a fait le choix conscient de refuser de signer. La Commission soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le fardeau de prouver que les politiques de l\u2019employeur \u00e9taient raisonnables ou \u00e9quitables ni que la conduite de l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Elle dit qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres moyens qui permettent \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de soulever ces arguments. La Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour l\u2019employeur de modifier ses politiques au fil du temps et d\u2019exiger que le personnel les signe pour fournir une attestation.\n[27] En ce qui concerne le compte rendu du r\u00e8glement conclu entre l\u2019appelant et son ancien employeur, la Commission fait valoir que ce compte rendu ne contient aucune preuve permettant de r\u00e9futer ses conclusions ant\u00e9rieures selon lesquelles il y a eu inconduite. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision et d\u2019une entente entre les parties pour r\u00e9gler l\u2019affaire \u00e0 l\u2019amiable. La Commission affirme que l\u2019entente entre l\u2019appelant et son employeur ne prouve pas qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu inconduite.\n[28] L\u2019appelant affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu inconduite parce que son employeur n\u2019avait pas de motif valable de le cong\u00e9dier. Il explique qu\u2019il n\u2019a commis aucune inconduite au cours des quatre ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 cet emploi. Il a re\u00e7u la pleine prime au rendement et n\u2019a jamais cess\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir ses t\u00e2ches, malgr\u00e9 le comportement abusif de son employeur, comme indiqu\u00e9 dans le dossier d\u2019appel.\n[29] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui a donn\u00e9 la permission de travailler de la maison. Il \u00e9tait coordonnateur des m\u00e9dias sociaux et directeur du marketing. Une partie de ses t\u00e2ches consistait \u00e0 faire du montage vid\u00e9o. Les vid\u00e9os \u00e9taient film\u00e9es sur l\u2019un des lieux de travail de l\u2019employeur. L\u2019appelant utilisait son propre mat\u00e9riel informatique et ses propres logiciels pour faire le montage. En effet, il avait obtenu la permission de l\u2019employeur parce que celui-ci ne voulait pas fournir le mat\u00e9riel ou les logiciels. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait un bureau \u00e0 l\u2019un des lieux de travail de son employeur.\n[30] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 en 2022 pour effectuer une partie du travail li\u00e9 au montage vid\u00e9o, sous la supervision de l\u2019appelant. Cet employ\u00e9 lui a demand\u00e9 de venir travailler avec lui une journ\u00e9e. L\u2019appelant et l\u2019employ\u00e9 se trouvaient dans un bureau, apr\u00e8s la pause d\u00eener. Ils parlaient de sujets qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s au travail. L\u2019appelant a dit que son patron l\u2019a abord\u00e9 au bureau et a eu un comportement abusif envers lui, devant l\u2019employ\u00e9 avec qui il \u00e9tait. Son patron lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des excuses presque imm\u00e9diatement.\n[31] L\u2019appelant a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 une agente de Service Canada le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2023. L\u2019appelant lui a dit que son patron avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 crier apr\u00e8s l\u2019employ\u00e9 et lui, car ils \u00e9taient assis depuis 30 minutes \u00e0 parler de sujets qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s au travail alors qu\u2019ils disaient \u00eatre toujours occup\u00e9s. Son patron a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que travailler de la maison \u00e9tait stupide, que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas efficace et que personne ne devrait avoir le droit de travailler de la maison. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019agente qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son patron s\u2019il pouvait lui parler en priv\u00e9. Le patron a continu\u00e9 de traiter les personnes qui travaillent de la maison de paresseuses. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l\u2019appelant a demand\u00e9 au patron o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait pendant trois mois. Le patron avait travaill\u00e9 d\u2019un autre pays. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l\u2019appelant a dit que le patron s\u2019\u00e9tait excus\u00e9 et qu\u2019il avait admis avoir r\u00e9agi de fa\u00e7on excessive parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait stress\u00e9 et qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9foul\u00e9 sur l\u2019appelant.\n[32] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, apr\u00e8s la confrontation, il est retourn\u00e9 sur le lieu de travail et il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 partir de son bureau. On lui a alors dit qu\u2019il pouvait travailler de la maison un ou deux jours par semaine.\n[33] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir sign\u00e9 un contrat de travail qui indiquait qu\u2019il acceptait de se conformer aux politiques de l\u2019entreprise et que ces politiques pouvaient changer. Au cours des quatre ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles il occupait cet emploi, son patron lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait sign\u00e9 le guide de l\u2019employ\u00e9. L\u2019appelant r\u00e9pondait que non, parce qu\u2019il avait sign\u00e9 le contrat de travail, et on lui r\u00e9pondait [traduction] \u00ab oh, d\u2019accord, \u00e7a marche \u00bb.\n[34] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019environ trois semaines apr\u00e8s la confrontation, le sujet du guide de l\u2019employ\u00e9 est revenu. Il a dit que, sans pr\u00e9venir, son patron l\u2019a abord\u00e9 le 29 ao\u00fbt 2022 pour lui imposer des mesures disciplinaires. Le patron avait alors affirm\u00e9 que c\u2019est l\u2019appelant qui avait eu un comportement abusif. Il \u00e9tait attendu que l\u2019appelant soit d\u2019accord avec cette version des faits. On lui a demand\u00e9 de signer ce qu\u2019il croyait \u00eatre des extraits (les deux politiques) du guide de l\u2019employ\u00e9, selon lesquels l\u2019employeur pouvait le cong\u00e9dier pour tout ce qu\u2019il faisait en dehors de son lieu de travail et qui ne correspondait pas aux valeurs de son employeur. L\u2019appelant a dit \u00e0 son employeur qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise de signer.\n[35] Les deux politiques que l\u2019appelant devait signer figurent au dossier d\u2019appel. L\u2019une s\u2019appelle [traduction] \u00ab Politique sur l\u2019attitude et la conduite \u00bb, et l\u2019autre [traduction] \u00ab Code de conduite \u00bb. Aucune date n\u2019est indiqu\u00e9e sur ces politiques. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Politique sur l\u2019attitude et la conduite a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour dire que l\u2019ensemble des employ\u00e9es et employ\u00e9s devaient en tout temps adopter une conduite personnelle qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u2019incidence n\u00e9gative sur l\u2019employeur. Elle disait aussi que le personnel dont la conduite compromettait l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur \u00e9tait susceptible de faire l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu\u2019au cong\u00e9diement. L\u2019appelant ne savait pas si le Code de conduite avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune autre personne \u00e0 son travail n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e \u00e0 signer la politique modifi\u00e9e sur l\u2019attitude et la conduite au moment o\u00f9 on lui a demand\u00e9 de la signer.\n[36] L\u2019appelant pensait qu\u2019il continuerait \u00e0 travailler, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne signait pas les politiques ou l\u2019avertissement. Il a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 sa famille et \u00e0 un service juridique, dont l\u2019avis \u00e9tait unanime : il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il signe les documents. Il n\u2019y a pas eu inconduite. L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne lui avait pas remis une copie du guide de l\u2019employ\u00e9 au moment de son embauche. Il y avait des guides de l\u2019employ\u00e9 un peu partout sur son lieu de travail, et il a dit qu\u2019il connaissait les politiques et qu\u2019il les suivait.\n[37] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u de son patron une lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er septembre 2022. Dans cette lettre, il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit que l\u2019appelant avait jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but de son quart de travail du 6 septembre 2022 pour signer les documents ci-joints (les deux politiques). La lettre indiquait aussi que, comme la signature de ces documents \u00e9tait une condition d\u2019emploi, le refus de les signer entra\u00eenerait une suspension temporaire et non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9e ou un cong\u00e9diement.\n[38] L\u2019appelant s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au travail le 6 septembre 2023. Il a travaill\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 midi, heure \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9.\n[39] L\u2019appelant a fait valoir que son employeur avait conclu un r\u00e8glement avec lui. Dans le cadre de ce r\u00e8glement, l\u2019employeur a accept\u00e9 de retirer la mention [traduction] \u00ab cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour motif valable \u00bb. Il a re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son contrat de travail et de l\u2019argent pour ses frais juridiques.\n[40] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, le membre de la division d\u2019appel a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, dans sa premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de la conduite de l\u2019employeur ayant pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019\u00ab inconduite \u00bb de l\u2019appelant pour bien \u00e9valuer si sa conduite \u00e9tait intentionnelle ou nonNote de bas de page 11.\n[41] Dans l\u2019affaire Astolfi, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait de se concentrer uniquement sur la conduite du prestataire est une application trop \u00e9troite du crit\u00e8re juridique de l\u2019inconduite, car il y a une distinction entre la conduite d\u2019un employeur apr\u00e8s l\u2019inconduite pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e et la conduite d\u2019un employeur qui a pu avoir men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab inconduite \u00bb en premier lieuNote de bas de page 12.\n[42] Dans l\u2019affaire Astolfi, M. Astolfi a estim\u00e9 que le pr\u00e9sident et directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019entreprise l\u2019avait harcel\u00e9 lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, M. Astolfi a dit \u00e0 son employeur qu\u2019il continuerait \u00e0 travailler de la maison jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate ait lieu et que la situation soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. L\u2019employeur a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Astolfi de se pr\u00e9senter physiquement au travail, sans quoi il serait r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir abandonn\u00e9 son emploi. M. Astolfi ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 physiquement au travail. L\u2019employeur a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une \u00ab inconduite \u00bb, donc il l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Selon M. Astolfi, son refus de se pr\u00e9senter physiquement au travail d\u00e9coulait directement des gestes pos\u00e9s par son employeur avant l\u2019inconduite.\n[43] Dans l\u2019affaire Astolfi, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait raisonnable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale examine la conduite de l\u2019employeur avant l\u2019inconduite de l\u2019appelant (c\u2019est moi qui souligne). De cette fa\u00e7on, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut \u00e9valuer correctement si la conduite de M. Astolfi \u00e9tait intentionnelle ou non. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait examiner les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement de M. Astolfi dans leur contexte global.\n[44] \u00c0 mon avis, une \u00e9valuation visant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si la \u00ab conduite \u00e9tait intentionnelle ou non \u00bb revient en fait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer si la conduite de la partie appelante \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, consciente ou voulue dans le contexte des actions de l\u2019employeur \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la conduite de la partie appelante.\n[45] L\u2019appelant affirme que son employeur a eu un comportement abusif lorsqu\u2019il a confront\u00e9 l\u2019appelant et son employ\u00e9 parce qu\u2019ils parlaient de sujets qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s au travail. La confrontation a eu lieu de deux \u00e0 trois semaines avant que son patron lui demande de signer une lettre d\u2019avertissement verbal et deux politiques.\n[46] La lettre d\u2019avertissement verbal que l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7ue disait que [traduction] \u00ab le rendement et la productivit\u00e9 ainsi que la conduite non professionnelle et le rendement au travail ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux normes de l\u2019entreprise \u00bb. La lettre exigeait que l\u2019appelant se pr\u00e9sente sur place pour chaque quart de travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait une am\u00e9lioration importante du rendement et du comportement.\n[47] La lettre disait aussi :\n[Traduction]\nIl y a r\u00e9cemment eu un incident avec [le patron] pendant lequel vous avez r\u00e9agi lorsque vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019une discussion que vous aviez avec un autre employ\u00e9. Vous avez adopt\u00e9 un comportement tr\u00e8s conflictuel et, quand il y a eu une tentative de d\u00e9samorcer la situation, vous \u00eates revenu et avez agi de fa\u00e7on non professionnelle en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s.\n[48] La lettre indiquait aussi ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab En plus de cet avertissement, vous \u00eates responsable de revoir et de signer les politiques \u201cAttitude et conduite\u201d et \u201cCode de conduite\u201d ci-jointes, et de me les retourner au plus tard le 30 ao\u00fbt 2022. \u00bb\n[49] La preuve m\u2019indique que la confrontation avec son patron est la raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelant a re\u00e7u une lettre d\u2019avertissement verbal et a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par la suite. J\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019appelant selon lequel son patron a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019instigateur de la confrontation et s\u2019en est d\u2019ailleurs excus\u00e9. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 constant dans sa version des faits lorsqu\u2019il a parl\u00e9 au personnel de Service Canada, tout comme dans son appel ainsi que dans son t\u00e9moignage devant moi.\n[50] L\u2019appelant estime avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de la confrontation et parce que son patron \u00e9tait embarrass\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de cette confrontation. L\u2019appelant est d\u2019avis qu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 de signer les deux politiques pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en raison de la confrontation. L\u2019appelant a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la demande de signature des deux politiques comme un moyen pour l\u2019employeur de le cong\u00e9dier \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment pour tout comportement qu\u2019il pourrait adopter dans le futur avec lequel l\u2019employeur ne serait pas d\u2019accord. L\u2019employeur avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 accept\u00e9 sa signature sur le contrat de travail comme une attestation suffisante des politiques. Pour cette raison, l\u2019appelant ne pensait pas pouvoir \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour avoir refus\u00e9 de signer les deux politiques.\n[51] Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019employeur a dit au personnel de Service Canada que ce n\u2019est pas le comportement de l\u2019appelant ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 la mesure disciplinaire qui a men\u00e9 \u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement, mais plut\u00f4t son refus de signer les documents apr\u00e8s que la mesure disciplinaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019employeur a ajout\u00e9 que si l\u2019appelant avait sign\u00e9 les documents, il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de son emploi.\n[52] Je conclus que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, le refus de l\u2019appelant de signer les politiques n\u2019est pas une inconduite.\n[53] La preuve est claire : pendant quatre ans, l\u2019employeur a accept\u00e9 la signature de l\u2019appelant sur le contrat de travail comme une attestation suffisante de ses politiques. Il est tout aussi clair que l\u2019obligation de signer les deux politiques a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9e seulement quelques semaines apr\u00e8s que l\u2019appelant et son patron ont eu une confrontation. L\u2019employeur exigeait que l\u2019appelant signe les deux politiques dans le contexte de l\u2019avertissement verbal qu\u2019il devait signer pour exprimer son accord avec la version des faits du patron concernant l\u2019incident.\n[54] L\u2019appelant a refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter la version des faits de son patron. Il n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires et il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son comportement pendant la confrontation. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour avoir refus\u00e9 d\u2019accepter la version des faits de son patron. La raison du cong\u00e9diement d\u00e9coule plut\u00f4t du refus de l\u2019appelant de signer les deux politiques, comme l\u2019employeur l\u2019avait demand\u00e9, dans le contexte o\u00f9 il a re\u00e7u une lettre d\u2019avertissement verbal.\n[55] \u00c0 mon avis, cela signifie que son employeur s\u2019est servi du fait qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de signer les politiques comme excuse pour le cong\u00e9dier, et qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de la raison de son cong\u00e9diement. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019estime que, m\u00eame si l\u2019appelant a choisi de ne pas signer les politiques, sa conduite n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, consciente ou voulue, car son employeur utilisait son refus de signer pour d\u00e9guiser son cong\u00e9diement. La Commission ne s\u2019est donc pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau qui lui incombait de prouver que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison de sa propre inconduite selon la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e plus haut.\nAlors, l\u2019appelant a-t-il perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite? [56] Selon mes conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite.\nConclusion [57] La Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. C\u2019est pourquoi l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[58] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nUne personne qui demande des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi est une partie \u00ab prestataire \u00bb.

La permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e. L\u2019appel n\u2019ira donc pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La demanderesse est la succession de D. S. (la succession). Je d\u00e9signerai feue D. S. comme la prestataire, car l\u2019appel concerne sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[3] La d\u00e9fenderesse, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada, a vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire des prestations au titre du programme de prestation d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi d\u2019urgence. En vertu de ce programme, les prestataires avaient droit \u00e0 une prestation hebdomadaire de 500 $ s\u2019ils satisfaisaient aux exigences. Afin que les prestataires obtiennent rapidement un soutien, la loi autorisait la Commission \u00e0 verser imm\u00e9diatement les prestationsNote de bas de page 1. La Commission a vers\u00e9 aux prestataires une avance de 2 000 $ sur les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence auxquelles ils seraient admissibles dans les semaines ult\u00e9rieures. La Commission s\u2019attendait \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer l\u2019avance en retenant le paiement des prestations au cours de certaines de ces semaines.\n[4] La prestataire a re\u00e7u cette avance de 2 000 $. Cependant, elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail et a cess\u00e9 de demander la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence avant que la Commission ait eu la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer l\u2019avance. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire un avis de dette pour la r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer.\n[5] Lorsque la prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de r\u00e9vision, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019elle devrait rembourser l\u2019avance de 2 000 $. Elle a fait valoir qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019assurance-emploi et qu\u2019elle avait plut\u00f4t re\u00e7u la Prestation canadienne d\u2019urgence. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le trop-pay\u00e9 \u00e9tait une erreur du gouvernement et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas les moyens de le rembourserNote de bas de page 2.\n[6] La prestataire est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e avant que la Commission puisse rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la demande de r\u00e9vision. La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas modifier sa d\u00e9cision et l\u2019a envoy\u00e9e au repr\u00e9sentant de la succession. La succession a fait appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, mais la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel. La succession demande maintenant la permission de faire appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel.\n[7] Je refuse la permission de faire appel parce que la succession n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, une erreur de droit ou une erreur de fait importante.\nQuestions en litige [8] Les questions que je dois trancher sont les suivantes :\na) La demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en retard? b) Devrais-je prolonger le d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande? c) Y a-t-il une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale? d) Y a-t-il une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit? e) Y a-t-il une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait importante?\nAnalyse La demande \u00e9tait en retard [9] Dans son avis d\u2019appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la succession a fourni une adresse postale, mais n\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 communiquer avec la succession par courriel. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 11 septembre 2023 et l\u2019a post\u00e9e \u00e0 la succession le m\u00eame jour.\n[10] Quand le Tribunal envoie un document \u00e0 une partie par la poste ordinaire, selon ses R\u00e8gles, cette partie est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ayant re\u00e7u le document 10 jours apr\u00e8s la date de l\u2019envoiNote de bas de page 3. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale permettent \u00e9galement \u00e0 une partie de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre assujettie \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gleNote de bas de page 4.\n[11] Dans la demande de la succession aupr\u00e8s de la division d\u2019appel, son repr\u00e9sentant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019indiquer la date \u00e0 laquelle il a re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le dossier du Tribunal ne contient aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve concernant la date \u00e0 laquelle la succession a re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision.\n[12] La succession n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle de livraison des documents ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer, ce qui signifie qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique. Il faut pr\u00e9sumer que la succession a re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision 10 jours apr\u00e8s la date de son envoi. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e le 11 septembre 2023, de sorte que la succession est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision \u00e9crite le 21 septembre 2023.\n[13] Le d\u00e9lai pour faire appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devant la division d\u2019appel est de 30 jours \u00e0 compter de la date \u00e0 laquelle la d\u00e9cision est communiqu\u00e9e par \u00e9crit. La date limite serait le 21 octobre 2023.\n[14] La division d\u2019appel n\u2019a re\u00e7u la demande de la succession que le 2 novembre 2023.\n[15] L\u2019appel est en retard.\nJe prolonge le d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la demande [16] Pour d\u00e9cider si je dois accorder une prolongation de d\u00e9lai, je dois examiner la question de savoir si la succession a une explication raisonnable justifiant le retard de la demandeNote de bas de page 5.\n[17] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec son d\u00e9put\u00e9 provincial et qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 des conseils juridiques \u00e0 la clinique juridique Kinna-aweya dans sa ville natale. Il affirme que tous deux \u00e9taient trop occup\u00e9s pour l\u2019aider imm\u00e9diatement.\n[18] J\u2019accepte le fait que la succession a une explication raisonnable pour le retard. Le retard n\u2019\u00e9tait que de 12 jours et \u00e9tait d\u00fb en partie au fait que le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des conseils en temps opportun.\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la succession la permission de faire appel Principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [19] Pour que la demande de permission de faire appel de la succession soit accueillie, ses motifs d\u2019appel devraient correspondre aux \u00ab moyens d\u2019appel \u00bb. Les moyens d\u2019appel sont les types d\u2019erreurs que je peux consid\u00e9rer.\n[20] Je peux seulement tenir compte des erreurs suivantes :\na) Le processus d\u2019audience devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9quitable d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on. b) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher. Ou bien, elle a tranch\u00e9 une question qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de trancher (erreur de comp\u00e9tence). c) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur de fait importante. d) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu une d\u00e9cision entach\u00e9e d\u2019une erreur de droitNote de bas de page 6.\n[21] Pour accorder cette demande de permission de faire appel et permettre au processus d\u2019appel d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant, je dois conclure qu\u2019un ou plusieurs moyens d\u2019appel conf\u00e8rent \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. D\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions judiciaires ont assimil\u00e9 une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s \u00e0 une \u00ab cause d\u00e9fendableNote de bas de page 7 \u00bb.\nErreur d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale [22] L\u2019un des moyens d\u2019appel retenus par le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession \u00e9tait celui qui concernait l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[23] Cependant, la succession n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a agi de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9quitable.\n[24] L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale concerne l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de savoir si une partie estime que le r\u00e9sultat de la d\u00e9cision est \u00e9quitable.\n[25] Les parties devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ont droit \u00e0 certaines protections proc\u00e9durales, comme le droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendues et de conna\u00eetre la preuve qui p\u00e8se contre elles, et le droit \u00e0 un d\u00e9cideur impartial.\n[26] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une audience en personne devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il n\u2019a pas dit que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la succession une chance \u00e9quitable de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience ou qu\u2019il ne savait pas ce qui se passait \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il n\u2019a pas dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu une chance \u00e9quitable de pr\u00e9senter les arguments de la succession ou de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ceux de la Commission. Il ne s\u2019est pas plaint que le membre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait partial ou qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire.\n[27] Lorsque je lis la d\u00e9cision et que j\u2019examine le dossier d\u2019appel, je ne vois pas que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fait quoi que ce soit ou n\u2019a pas fait quoi que ce soit qui m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 douter de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du processus.\nErreur de droit [28] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession n\u2019est pas certain de la raison pour laquelle la prestataire n\u2019approuvait pas la d\u00e9cision, mais il affirme qu\u2019il croit que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit.\n[29] Il mentionne que l\u2019article 153.1306 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi permet \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019annuler des trop-pay\u00e9s lorsque la d\u00e9bitrice ou le d\u00e9biteur est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.\n[30] Il n\u2019y a aucune cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019annuler la dette. Bien que la Commission ait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019annuler la dette, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne l\u2019a pas. Elle n\u2019a pas non plus le pouvoir d\u2019examiner un appel port\u00e9 contre le refus de la Commission d\u2019annuler la dette. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il serait prudent que la succession demande officiellement \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019annuler la dette, si elle ne l\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait.\n[31] Je souligne que la prestataire a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision parce qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019assurance-emploi r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u la \u00ab Prestation canadienne d\u2019urgence \u00bb (qui \u00e9tait en fait la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence).\n[32] Il n\u2019y a aucune cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit ou de comp\u00e9tence en examinant seulement la question de savoir si la prestataire devait rembourser la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence.\n[33] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 examiner que les questions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision de la CommissionNote de bas de page 8. La d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision de la Commission \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 4 mai 2023. Dans la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision, la question est d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant le [traduction] \u00ab trop-pay\u00e9 de la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence \u00bb. Elle indique que la Commission [traduction] \u00ab maintient \u00bb (ne change pas) sa d\u00e9cision sur cette question.\n[34] Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire que l\u2019objet de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision \u00e9tait autre chose que le remboursement de l\u2019avance de 2 000 $ au titre des dispositions de la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence. La demande de r\u00e9vision de la prestataire fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au remboursement de la \u00ab Prestation canadienne d\u2019urgence \u00bb. Elle a discut\u00e9 de la question du remboursement avec la Commission le 6 juillet 2022, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de dette le 5 juillet 2022. Lorsque la succession s\u2019est entretenue avec la Commission le 4 mai 2023 au sujet de la demande de r\u00e9vision, la discussion a port\u00e9 sur le remboursement de l\u2019avance de la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence et du trop-pay\u00e9.\n[35] La prestataire n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas re\u00e7u les prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance-emploi qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9es, mais il n\u2019y a aucune cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit ou de fait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la nature des prestations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es. La Commission n\u2019avait bel et bien d\u2019autre choix que de traiter les demandes de prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et de maladie re\u00e7ues entre le 15 mars 2020 et le 26 septembre 2020 comme des demandes de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence.\nErreur de fait [36] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait en ne tenant pas compte de la preuve de \u00ab Charlene \u00bb, une employ\u00e9e de Service CanadaNote de bas de page 9.\n[37] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, je reconnais que le repr\u00e9sentant de la succession est le mari de la d\u00e9funte prestataire et non un avocat ou un d\u00e9fenseur professionnel. Il n\u2019a peut-\u00eatre pas bien compris comment cerner les erreurs potentielles dans la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ai suivi l\u2019exemple des tribunaux et examin\u00e9 le dossier afin de d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait importante en interpr\u00e9tant mal ou en \u00e9cartant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinentsNote de bas de page 10.\n[38] J\u2019ai notamment examin\u00e9 les notes de Charlene dans le dossier de la Commission. Charlene est l\u2019agente qui a fait le suivi de la demande de r\u00e9vision de la prestataire. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 au repr\u00e9sentant de la succession pourquoi la prestataire \u00e9tait oblig\u00e9e de rembourser l\u2019avance.\n[39] L\u2019agente a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 des renseignements \u00e0 la succession et \u00e0 l\u2019employeur pour voir si la Commission pourrait \u00eatre en mesure de compenser une partie de l\u2019avance pay\u00e9e sur d\u2019autres semaines de prestations non demand\u00e9es (auxquelles la prestataire aurait pu avoir droit si elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes). L\u2019agente a exclu cette possibilit\u00e9 en raison des renseignements sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7us de l\u2019employeur.\n[40] Je ne vois rien dans les notes de l\u2019agente ou dans le dossier de la Commission en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qui sugg\u00e8re une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9cart\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment pertinent.\n[41] Malheureusement pour la succession, je n\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 aucun cas de mauvais traitement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[42] Il n\u2019y a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait importante.\nConclusion [43] J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 une prolongation de d\u00e9lai. Toutefois, j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 la permission de faire appel.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] D. L., la requ\u00e9rante, a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada le 23 novembre 2021. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 13 septembre 2022, le ministre l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il maintenait sa d\u00e9cision initiale apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision et rejetait donc sa demandeNote de bas de page 1.\n[3] La requ\u00e9rante a fait appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale le 10 novembre 2023Note de bas de page 2. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas retenir son appel, parce que la requ\u00e9rante avait fait appel plus d\u2019un apr\u00e8s an apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du ministre. La requ\u00e9rante a demand\u00e9 la permission de faire appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel.\nQuestions en litige [4] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait-elle avoir commis une erreur de fait en ignorant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants justifiant le retard de la requ\u00e9rante? b) La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9sente-t-elle, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [5] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant les faits au droitNote de bas de page 3.\n[6] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 4.\n[7] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve li\u00e9s \u00e0 la question que je dois trancher, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait en ignorant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants [8] On ne peut pas soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait en ignorant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve importants. La requ\u00e9rante affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte du fait qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 du gouvernement provincial l\u2019avait mal renseign\u00e9e en lui disant d\u2019attendre avant de faire appelNote de bas de page 5.\n[9] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale explique que le Tribunal ne peut en aucun cas accepter un appel si une personne le d\u00e9pose plus d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision du ministreNote de bas de page 6. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait fait appel apr\u00e8s plus d\u2019un an. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne pouvait aucunement prolonger ce d\u00e9lai sur la base des mauvais conseils que la requ\u00e9rante a expliqu\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7us d\u2019un employ\u00e9 du gouvernement provincial.\n[10] Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir commis une erreur en ignorant la preuve sur les raisons du retard de la requ\u00e9rante. La loi ne donnait aucun pouvoir \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour lui conc\u00e9der un plus long d\u00e9lai, peu importe la raison pour laquelle elle en avait besoin.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui justifierait d\u2019accorder la permission de faire appel [11] La requ\u00e9rante a soumis une \u00e9valuation de sa capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle datant du 28 juillet 2023Note de bas de page 7. Je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une preuve qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Toutefois, comme la requ\u00e9rante a fait appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale plus d\u2019un an apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision du ministre, cette \u00e9valuation est sans incidence sur la question que je dois trancher, et ne peut donc pas justifier de lui accorder la permission de faire appel.\n[12] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la preuve concernant le moment o\u00f9 le ministre a communiqu\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante ou le moment o\u00f9 la requ\u00e9rante a fait appelNote de bas de page 8.\nConclusion [13] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.

M\u00eame si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 un document, cela n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat.\nAper\u00e7u [2] L\u2019appelante, B. F. (la prestataire), fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada, a prouv\u00e9 que la prestataire a perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Autrement dit, elle a fait ou omis de faire quelque chose qui lui a fait perdre son emploi. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Par cons\u00e9quent, la prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[3] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence, de proc\u00e9dure, de droit et de fait. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable et que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait importante en d\u00e9cidant si elle s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur.\n[4] Au titre de la politique, la prestataire devait divulguer son statut vaccinal. La prestataire affirme l\u2019avoir divulgu\u00e9 et s\u2019\u00eatre donc conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Puisqu\u2019elle a respect\u00e9 la politique de vaccination de son employeur, elle nie avoir commis une inconduite.\n[5] La prestataire demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel de conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019a commis aucune inconduite et qu\u2019elle est admissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[6] La Commission convient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut vaccinal. Toutefois, elle soutient que l\u2019erreur de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne change pas le r\u00e9sultat puisqu\u2019elle affirme qu\u2019elle a quand m\u00eame commis une inconduite. La Commission demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel de rejeter l\u2019appel.\nQuestions en litige [7] Voici les questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent appel :\na) La prestataire a-t-elle eu droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable? b) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle omis d\u2019appliquer les principes du Guide de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9? c) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle omis de d\u00e9cider si la prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort? d) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle bien soupes\u00e9 la preuve? e) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle ignor\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de la prestataire? f) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis une erreur de fait au sujet de la raison pour laquelle l\u2019employeur a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire? g) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve? h) Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des questions ci-dessus est \u00ab oui \u00bb, cela change-t-il le r\u00e9sultat?\nAnalyse [8] La division d\u2019appel peut intervenir dans les d\u00e9cisions de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale si celle-ci a commis une erreur de comp\u00e9tence, de proc\u00e9dure, de droit ou certains types d\u2019erreurs de faitNote de bas de page 1.\n[9] Pour ce type d\u2019erreurs de fait, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit avoir fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur cette erreur et elle doit avoir commis l\u2019erreur de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissanceNote de bas de page 2.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fourni une audience \u00e9quitable \u00e0 la prestataire [10] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tenu une audience \u00e9quitable. M\u00eame si elle a accept\u00e9 des documents de la Commission apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, la membre a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire une occasion \u00e9quitable de r\u00e9pondre. La prestataire a pu d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse. En fin de compte, le membre n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de la prestataire, concluant que le document n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinent et donc irrecevable. Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas que le processus \u00e9tait in\u00e9quitable puisque la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le droit d\u2019\u00e9valuer le document et d\u2019\u00e9tablir son admissibilit\u00e9.\n[11] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne lui a pas fourni une audience \u00e9quitable parce qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations de la Commission apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience du 25 janvier 2023, tout en rejetant sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce document.\n[12] Le 25 janvier 2023, le Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale a re\u00e7u des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires de la Commission (page GD10 du dossier d\u2019appel). La Commission r\u00e9pondait aux documents que la prestataire avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9s le (dimanche) 22 janvier 2023 (page GD8 du dossier d\u2019appel). (Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire circuler le document tardif de la prestataire \u00e0 la Commission avant la veille de l\u2019audience.)\n[13] Dans ses observations suppl\u00e9mentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience (page GD10 du dossier d\u2019appel), la Commission a fait valoir que les nouveaux documents de la prestataire (page GD8 du dossier d\u2019appel) \u00e9taient en grande partie non pertinents, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019un \u00e9change de courriels que la prestataire a eu avec son gestionnaire de cas. La Commission a soutenu que les courriels montraient que, malgr\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 de maladie, la prestataire savait qu\u2019elle devait respecter la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Autrement, elle risquait d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9eNote de bas de page 3.\n[14] La prestataire semble laisser entendre que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rejeter le document produit apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience par la Commission (page GD10 du dossier d\u2019appel) parce que l\u2019audience \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9e. Toutefois, la Commission r\u00e9pondait aux documents (page GD8 du dossier d\u2019appel) que la prestataire avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9s pr\u00e8s de la date de l\u2019audience.\n[15] Le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 la prestataire le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2023Note de bas de page 4. Il lui a dit qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u des documents (page GD10 du dossier d\u2019appel) de la Commission apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience. La membre a accept\u00e9 le document. Le Tribunal a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab si vous avez d\u2019autres arguments en r\u00e9ponse au document, nous devons les recevoir au plus tard le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2023 \u00bb.\n[16] Ce d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait raisonnable. Les faits et les questions en litige \u00e9taient assez simples.\n[17] La prestataire a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2023. La prestataire a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u la lettre du Tribunal l\u2019invitant \u00e0 fournir une r\u00e9ponse au document produit apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience par la Commission au plus tard le 10 f\u00e9vrier 2023. M\u00eame si la date limite \u00e9tait pass\u00e9e, le Tribunal l\u2019a quand m\u00eame invit\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9ponse. Par la suite, la prestataire a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal avec ses arguments.\n[18] La prestataire a remis en question l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 des vaccins contre la COVID-19. Elle avait fait une capture d\u2019\u00e9cran de la liste des effets ind\u00e9sirables possibles des vaccins de la Food and Drug Administration des \u00c9tats-Unis.\n[19] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 le courriel de la prestataire. Le membre a expliqu\u00e9 que les observations de la prestataire n\u2019\u00e9taient pertinentes \u00e0 aucune des questions de droitNote de bas de page 5. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab ne peut pas remettre en question l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des vaccins contre la COVID-19 ni le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la politique de vaccination contre la COVID-19 d\u2019un employeur \u00bbNote de bas de page 6.\n[20] La prestataire affirme que c\u2019\u00e9tait injuste, mais la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le droit de d\u00e9cider si les documents de la prestataire devaient \u00eatre accept\u00e9s ou rejet\u00e9s en fonction de leur pertinence. (Si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait accept\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de la prestataire apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, comme la prestataire dit qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb le faire, la question de l\u2019importance \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse aurait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e. Cependant, cela n\u2019aurait pas non plus satisfait la prestataire. Il ne fait aucun doute que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019aurait accord\u00e9 aucune importance \u00e0 sa preuve apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience.)\n[21] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fourni \u00e0 la prestataire une copie du document produit par la Commission apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience et elle lui a aussi donn\u00e9 une chance raisonnable de r\u00e9pondre. La prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse. Elle ne peut donc pas dire qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas eu droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le droit de juger de la pertinence et de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la r\u00e9ponse de la prestataire.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit en n\u2019appliquant pas les principes du Guide de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 [22] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit en omettant d\u2019appliquer les principes du Guide de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9Note de bas de page 7. Les all\u00e9gations de la prestataire visent la Commission plut\u00f4t que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[23] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 le chapitre 7 du Guide de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Elle affirme que ce chapitre exige que la Commission \u00e9value objectivement les faits tels qu\u2019ils sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par une partie prestataire et son employeur, puis qu\u2019elle se prononce en faveur de la version des faits qui semble la plus cr\u00e9dible. Il ne dit rien sur ce que l\u2019on peut attendre de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[24] Le Guide peut servir de guide \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour interpr\u00e9ter la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Cependant, la jurisprudence dit que le Guide n\u2019a pas un caract\u00e8re obligatoire et ne remplace pas la loi elle-m\u00eame.\n[25] Dans une affaire appel\u00e9e Greey, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9crit le Guide comme [traduction] \u00ab un manuel d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation qui ne lie pas la Cour \u00bbNote de bas de page 8. Toutefois, on dit aussi \u00ab qu\u2019il faut en tenir compte et qu\u2019il peut constituer un facteur important dans l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois \u00bbNote de bas de page 9.\n[26] Outre le fait que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de suivre le Guide, les all\u00e9gations de la prestataire sont dirig\u00e9es contre la Commission.\n[27] La prestataire affirme que la Commission n\u2019a pas suivi le Guide parce qu\u2019elle ne lui a pas remis de copies de ses notes ni donn\u00e9 l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux d\u00e9clarations que son employeur aurait faites \u00e0 la Commission. Son employeur aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le service de sant\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s l\u2019avait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 retourner au travail en d\u00e9cembre 2021. La prestataire nie que son m\u00e9decin l\u2019ait autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 retourner au travail \u00e0 ce moment.\n[28] Il se peut que la prestataire n\u2019ait pas re\u00e7u de copies des d\u00e9clarations de son employeur ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas eu pleinement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux d\u00e9clarations avant que la Commission ne rende sa d\u00e9cision ou ne r\u00e9vise sa d\u00e9cision. Cependant, ces lacunes sont celles de la Commission, et non de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Elles ne constituent pas le fondement d\u2019un moyen d\u2019appel contre la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[29] M\u00eame s\u2019il y a peut-\u00eatre eu des lacunes proc\u00e9durales dans le traitement de la demande par la Commission, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale y a rem\u00e9di\u00e9. Le Tribunal a fourni aux deux parties une copie de tous les documents. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la prestataire l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre pleinement \u00e0 tout. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et elle a \u00e9galement eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de vive voix \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Autrement dit, si la Commission a caus\u00e9 des lacunes proc\u00e9durales en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la divulgation et \u00e0 l\u2019obtention d\u2019une chance de r\u00e9pondre, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale les a corrig\u00e9es.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider si la prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort [30] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit lorsqu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider si la prestataire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort.\n[31] La prestataire soutient que son employeur l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort, car elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. La prestataire a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie le 29 septembre 2021Note de bas de page 10. Son employeur s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle retourne au travailNote de bas de page 11, mais elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas encore re\u00e7u l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale pour le faire. Elle fait remarquer qu\u2019elle a eu un suivi avec son m\u00e9decin le 11 janvier 2022.\n[32] Comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a soulign\u00e9, elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider si son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort. La d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sur ce point \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 la jurisprudenceNote de bas de page 12. Elle n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de droit sur cette question.\n[33] Il y a d\u2019autres voies que la prestataire peut emprunter en cas de cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a soulign\u00e9, la prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des griefs contre son employeur.\nLa division d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a bien soupes\u00e9 la preuve [34] La division d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a bien soupes\u00e9 la preuve.\n[35] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas soupes\u00e9 correctement la preuve. Toutefois, cette affaire ne fait pas partie des moyens d\u2019appel pr\u00e9vus par la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\n[36] L\u2019attribution du poids est une question qui rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du juge des faits, car il est le mieux plac\u00e9 pour \u00e9valuer la preuve et d\u00e9terminer le poids qu\u2019il convient d\u2019attribuer. Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb accorder plus d\u2019importance ou d\u2019attention \u00e0 tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui \u00e9tait en faveur de la prestataire.\nLa prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 [37] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 la preuve. Elle nie avoir commis une inconduite parce qu\u2019elle dit qu\u2019elle ne travaillait pas et que son m\u00e9decin n\u2019avait pas autoris\u00e9 son retour au travail pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Elle affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 cette consid\u00e9ration importante.\n[38] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait consciente de cette question et des arguments de la prestataire. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que la prestataire et l\u2019employeur ont contest\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de la prestataire \u00e0 retourner au travail apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Elle a aussi affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur avait \u00e9tabli que la prestataire \u00e9tait en bonne condition physique et qu\u2019il avait mis fin \u00e0 ses paiements de remplacement du revenu d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Pour sa part, la prestataire a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait assez bien pour retourner au travailNote de bas de page 13.\n[39] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 la preuve de la prestataire au sujet du litige. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant ses griefs syndicaux contre son employeur relativement \u00e0 son cong\u00e9 de maladie et \u00e0 sa prestation de remplacement du revenuNote de bas de page 14.\n[40] Mais il est \u00e9galement clair que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas d\u00e9cid\u00e9 si la prestataire \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. Elle n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner si la prestataire \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement apte \u00e0 retourner au travail et d\u2019\u00e9valuer si son employeur avait eu raison de la cong\u00e9dier. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli la port\u00e9e de ses pouvoirs de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e.\n[41] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu inconduite, malgr\u00e9 le diff\u00e9rend entre la prestataire et son employeur. Elle devait se concentrer sur la question de savoir si la prestataire avait intentionnellement commis un acte (ou omis de commettre un acte) contraire \u00e0 ses obligations professionnellesNote de bas de page 15.\n[42] De toute \u00e9vidence, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a admis que l\u2019emploi de la prestataire l\u2019obligeait \u00e0 se faire vacciner et \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal, m\u00eame s\u2019il y avait un diff\u00e9rend au sujet de son aptitude m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 retourner au travail. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a correctement appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 l\u2019inconduite et a conclu qu\u2019il y avait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui permettaient de conclure qu\u2019il y avait inconduite.\n[43] La question de l\u2019aptitude m\u00e9dicale de la prestataire \u00e0 retourner au travail, probablement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 tort pendant un cong\u00e9 de maladie, peut \u00eatre abord\u00e9e dans une autre tribune.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de fait concernant la raison pour laquelle l\u2019employeur a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire [44] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019erreur de fait concernant la raison pour laquelle l\u2019employeur a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que la prestataire affirme, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e, pas seulement parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut vaccinal. Cela concorde avec la preuve. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tir\u00e9 cette conclusion beaucoup plus tard dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n[45] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tir\u00e9 une conclusion de fait non \u00e9tay\u00e9e selon laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e pour avoir refus\u00e9 de divulguer son statut vaccinal.\n[46] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9cider pourquoi la prestataire avait perdu son emploi et si la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi consid\u00e9rait ce motif comme une inconduiteNote de bas de page 16.\n[47] La prestataire affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019elle avait perdu son emploi parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut vaccinal. Cependant, elle affirme que la preuve montre qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait bel et bien d\u00e9clar\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est impossible qu\u2019elle ait commis une inconduite.\n[48] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a discut\u00e9 des raisons pour lesquelles la prestataire a perdu son emploiNote de bas de page 17. Elle l\u2019a fait dans la section intitul\u00e9e \u00ab La raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi \u00bb. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019employeur de la prestataire l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 sa politique de vaccination. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut de vaccination contre la COVID-19, ce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tenue de faire au titre de la politique de vaccination de son employeur.\n[49] Si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait conclu que l\u2019omission de faire une d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait la seule raison du cong\u00e9diement de la prestataire, j\u2019aurais jug\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait commis une erreur de fait.\n[50] La preuve montre que l\u2019employeur s\u2019attendait non seulement \u00e0 ce que la prestataire d\u00e9clare son statut, mais aussi \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle se fasse vacciner et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle l\u2019\u00e9taitNote de bas de page 18. Autrement, elle ne respecterait pas la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur. Cependant, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 cette exigence de vaccination dans la section \u00ab La raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelante a perdu son emploi \u00bb. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 utile qu\u2019elle fournisse cette explication.\n[51] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9crit l\u2019\u00e9tendue des obligations d\u2019emploi de la prestataire beaucoup plus loin dans sa d\u00e9cision, dans la section \u00ab La Commission a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu inconduite au titre de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi \u00bb.\n[52] L\u2019employeur a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas enti\u00e8rement conform\u00e9e \u00e0 sa politique mise \u00e0 jour. Selon celle-ci, la prestataire devait \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e, puis d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait fait vacciner. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la Commission avait prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu inconduite, car la preuve montrait que la prestataire savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019au titre de la politique de vaccination de son employeur, elle devait se faire enti\u00e8rement vacciner et d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal (mis \u00e0 jour), mais qu\u2019elle avait choisi de ne pas le faire.\n[53] Autrement dit, il est clair que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9tabli que la prestataire ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur parce qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas fait vacciner et qu\u2019elle a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait vaccin\u00e9e, et que c\u2019est ce qui a motiv\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement. Cela concorde avec la preuve.\n[54] La prestataire nie qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 se faire vacciner, mais elle dit qu\u2019elle voulait prendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e9clair\u00e9e. Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas qu\u2019elle se conformait \u00e0 la politique de son employeur. De plus, comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a \u00e9tabli, la preuve laissait entendre que la prestataire n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de se faire vacciner, compte tenu de ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet des vaccins contre la COVID-19.\n[55] Il y a un autre point \u00e0 aborder \u00e0 ce sujet. La preuve n\u2019inclut pas l\u2019avis de cong\u00e9diement, qui permettrait de confirmer le motif du cong\u00e9diement de la prestataire.\n[56] Apparemment, il semble que l\u2019employeur ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire pour ne pas avoir divulgu\u00e9 son statut vaccinal. Cependant, il semble \u00e9galement, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ses communications avec la prestataire et ses employ\u00e9s, qu\u2019il envisageait que la divulgation signifiait n\u00e9cessairement la vaccination. Autrement dit, l\u2019employeur a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 la prestataire parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e.\n[57] La prestataire a fourni des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires sur ce qu\u2019elle a compris \u00eatre la raison de son cong\u00e9diement.\n[58] Certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent qu\u2019elle croyait que son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019il croyait \u00e0 tort qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait jamais d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut. Cependant, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent \u00e9galement que la prestataire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait compris que son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vaccin\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 :\nDans sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, la prestataire a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur exigeait que tous les membres du personnel d\u00e9clarent leur statut et re\u00e7oivent le vaccin contre la COVID-19 au plus tard \u00e0 une date pr\u00e9ciseNote de bas de page 19. Lorsque la prestataire a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, elle a dit que son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas fourni de preuve de vaccinationNote de bas de page 20.\n[59] La prestataire a fait des efforts pour persuader son employeur qu\u2019elle devrait \u00eatre exempt\u00e9e de la vaccination en raison de ses pr\u00e9occupations concernant l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des vaccins. Elle a envoy\u00e9 un avis de responsabilit\u00e9 potentielle et un avis de communication. Cela donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019elle savait que le fait de d\u00e9clarer son statut, \u00e0 lui seul, \u00e9tait insuffisant pour se conformer aux exigences de son employeur et pour conserver son emploi. Il est peu probable qu\u2019elle se serait comport\u00e9e ainsi si elle croyait que le fait de rendre compte de son statut \u00e9tait suffisant pour se conformer aux obligations de son employeur.\n[60] Enfin, la lettre d\u2019avertissement de l\u2019employeur, dat\u00e9e du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2021, disait clairement que la prestataire devait se faire vacciner, sinon elle ferait l\u2019objet d\u2019autres mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu\u2019au cong\u00e9diementNote de bas de page 21.\n[61] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le droit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer la preuve de la prestataire d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle comprenait que son employeur l\u2019avait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e pour ne pas avoir fourni de preuve de vaccination. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concordaient avec les actions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de la prestataire expliquant pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vaccin\u00e9e.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve [62] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve. Elle a conclu qu\u2019une phrase particuli\u00e8re de la lettre d\u2019avertissement de pr\u00e9avis de cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019employeur du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2021 imposait \u00e0 la prestataire l\u2019obligation continue de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal.\n[63] D\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve exigeaient que la prestataire mette \u00e0 jour son statut vaccinal apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une premi\u00e8re et une deuxi\u00e8me dose du vaccin. Toutefois, la phrase de la lettre du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2021 n\u2019imposait aucune obligation de d\u00e9claration semblable.\n[64] Voici la phrase de la lettre :\n[traduction] Afin de donner suite \u00e0 la lettre qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2021, la pr\u00e9sente lettre a pour but de vous aviser que si vous ne d\u00e9clarez pas votre statut de vaccination contre la COVID-19 au plus tard demain, le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2021 \u00e0 12 h, vous serez cong\u00e9di\u00e9e de votre emploi pour cause \u00e0 compter du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2021Note de bas de page 22.\n[65] La prestataire affirme qu\u2019elle a compris qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal au plus tard le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2021. Elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut avant le 16 septembre 2021. Elle a alors d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 vaccin\u00e9e. Du point de vue de la prestataire, elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 satisfait aux exigences de son employeur en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9claration en septembre 2021.\n[66] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a pris note de l\u2019argument de la prestataire selon lequel elle s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal \u00e0 son employeur. Elle a conclu que la prestataire consid\u00e9rait cela comme une obligation ponctuelle. Toutefois, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu, en se fondant sur la phrase ci-dessus, que la prestataire avait \u00ab l\u2019obligation continue de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal \u00bbNote de bas de page 23 et que l\u2019avis \u00ab indique clairement qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00bbNote de bas de page 24.\n[67] La Commission affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal \u00e9valu\u00e9 la preuve sur ce point. La phrase disait clairement que la prestataire devait d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal au plus tard le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2021, mais elle n\u2019imposait pas une obligation continue ni ne pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9clarer de nouveau son statut vaccinal si elle l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9.\nM\u00eame si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 une phrase, cela n\u2019a rien chang\u00e9 au r\u00e9sultat [68] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 une phrase. La d\u00e9claration de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait techniquement correcte, \u00e0 savoir que la prestataire avait des obligations de d\u00e9claration continues, mais elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur la mauvaise phrase. M\u00eame si elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur la mauvaise phrase, le reste de la preuve appuyait ses conclusions selon lesquelles la prestataire avait une obligation continue de d\u00e9clarer (qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait vaccin\u00e9e).\n[69] La lettre d\u2019avertissement indiquait \u00e9galement que l\u2019employeur avait inform\u00e9 la prestataire que le d\u00e9faut de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal et de fournir sa preuve de vaccination entra\u00eenerait des mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu\u2019au cong\u00e9diement. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait correctement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 les exigences de d\u00e9claration de la prestataire si elle avait fourni ce contexte suppl\u00e9mentaire et si elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e uniquement sur la seule phrase de la lettre.\n[70] D\u2019autres communications de l\u2019employeur ont \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 les obligations de la prestataire de se faire vacciner et de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal. En ao\u00fbt 2021, l\u2019employeur a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la prestataire pour lui dire : [traduction] \u00ab Veuillez noter que les membres du personnel qui ne sont pas vaccin\u00e9s doivent aussi le d\u00e9clarer. Je sais que bon nombre d\u2019entre nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 notre statut vaccinal au cours des derni\u00e8res semaines, mais nous devons le faire une fois de plus et cette fois-ci, il faut aussi fournir une preuve de vaccination \u00bbNote de bas de page 25.\n[71] Au d\u00e9but, l\u2019employeur a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une certaine confusion au sujet de ses exigences, mais une fois qu\u2019il a mis \u00e0 jour sa politique en septembre 2021, il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre clair \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que la d\u00e9claration \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la vaccination obligatoire. La d\u00e9claration \u00e0 elle seule \u00e9tait insuffisante pour r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de l\u2019employeur. Les membres du personnel devaient se faire vaccinerNote de bas de page 26.\nL\u2019employeur a mis \u00e0 jour ses exigences de vaccination et de d\u00e9claration [72] L\u2019employeur avait mis \u00e0 jour sa politique de vaccination ainsi que ses exigences de d\u00e9claration. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait largement communiqu\u00e9 ses exigences mises \u00e0 jour le 7 octobre 2021, puis directement \u00e0 la prestataire le 14 octobre 2021Note de bas de page 27.\n[73] De plus, le 29 octobre 2021, l\u2019employeur a communiqu\u00e9 avec la prestataire par courriel et par la posteNote de bas de page 28. Il lui a dit qu\u2019elle avait jusqu\u2019au 30 novembre 2021 pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e. L\u2019employeur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u les deux doses requises du vaccin contre la COVID-19. Cela l\u2019a oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 jour son statut : une fois apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une premi\u00e8re dose et une autre fois, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une deuxi\u00e8me dose.\n[74] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre que la prestataire avait l\u2019obligation continue de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal, mais que cela \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019obtention des premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me doses.\n[75] Ce contexte, selon lequel l\u2019employeur exigeait que les membres du personnel d\u00e9clarent leur statut vaccinal apr\u00e8s une premi\u00e8re dose et de nouveau apr\u00e8s une deuxi\u00e8me dose, \u00e9tait important pour expliquer la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle la prestataire avait l\u2019obligation continue de d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas fourni ce contexte et a seulement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la seule phrase de la lettre d\u2019avis de cong\u00e9diement.\n[76] L\u2019employeur a \u00e9galement dit \u00e0 la prestataire que si elle ne fournissait pas de preuve de vaccination au plus tard le 30 novembre 2021, elle serait r\u00e9put\u00e9e ne pas \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e et ne pas \u00eatre conforme \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de la politique mise \u00e0 jour.\n[77] Enfin, l\u2019employeur a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les personnes qui ne respectaient pas sa politique de vaccination obligatoire feraient l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires pouvant aller jusqu\u2019au cong\u00e9diementNote de bas de page 29.\n[78] Dans un \u00e9change de courriels avec la prestataire le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2021, l\u2019employeur a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019avant de pouvoir revenir d\u2019un cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle devait [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9senter [son] statut vaccinal et une preuve de vaccination imm\u00e9diatement \u00bbNote de bas de page 30 [c\u2019est moi qui souligne].\n[79] L\u2019employeur a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 la prestataire plus tard le m\u00eame jour. Il l\u2019a inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle se conforme \u00e0 sa politique et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sente son statut vaccinal et une preuve de vaccination avant de revenir au travail le 24 d\u00e9cembre 2021Note de bas de page 31.\nLa prestataire ne s\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement conform\u00e9e aux exigences mises \u00e0 jour de son employeur [80] Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si la prestataire avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 son statut vaccinal d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, cela \u00e9tait insuffisant pour conserver son emploi. La lettre du 29 octobre 2021, les courriels du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2021 et la lettre d\u2019avertissement du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2021 soulignaient qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal et se faire vacciner.\n[81] La lettre d\u2019avertissement disait aussi ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 le 7 octobre 2021, \u00e0 compter du 30 novembre 2021 [l\u2019employeur] exige que tous les membres du personnel et tous les m\u00e9decins soient enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9s contre la COVID-19, sous r\u00e9serve seulement d\u2019exemptions limit\u00e9es. Nonobstant ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, si [la prestataire] d\u00e9clare [son] statut au plus tard le 30 d\u00e9cembre \u00e0 12 h, et si [elle] ne se conforme pas \u00e0 l\u2019article 4.3 de la politique sur la gestion de la vaccination contre la COVID-19 qui exige la vaccination obligatoire, [elle] fera \u00e9galement l\u2019objet d\u2019autres mesures disciplinaires, pouvant aller jusqu\u2019au cong\u00e9diementNote de bas de page 32.\n[82] Il ne suffisait pas que la prestataire d\u00e9clare simplement son statut vaccinal. Elle devait aussi d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter toute mesure disciplinaire, y compris le cong\u00e9diement.\n[83] Il est possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve en concluant que la phrase de la lettre d\u2019avertissement voulait dire que la prestataire devait d\u00e9clarer de nouveau son statut vaccinal au plus tard le 30 d\u00e9cembre 2021. Cependant, cela n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat, car la prestataire devait aussi d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement vaccin\u00e9e. La prestataire a omis sciemment de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette exigence de la politique de son employeur, tout en \u00e9tant au courant des cons\u00e9quences, ce qui signifiait qu\u2019elle avait commis une inconduite.\nConclusion [84] L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\n[85] La preuve n\u2019appuie pas les arguments de la prestataire voulant qu\u2019elle se soit enti\u00e8rement conform\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique de vaccination mise \u00e0 jour de son employeur. D\u00e9clarer son statut vaccinal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant. Elle devait aussi fournir une preuve de vaccination.\n[86] Comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a \u00e9tabli, la prestataire connaissait ou aurait d\u00fb conna\u00eetre les exigences de son employeur et les cons\u00e9quences en cas de non-respect. La prestataire a pris la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La demanderesse, K. B. (la prestataire), demande la permission de faire appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 13 octobre 2023.\n[3] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada, avait prouv\u00e9 que la prestataire avait perdu son emploi en raison d\u2019une inconduite. Autrement dit, elle a fait quelque chose qui lui a fait perdre son emploi.\n[4] En raison de son inconduite, la prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[5] La prestataire nie avoir commis une inconduite. Elle soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence, de droit et de fait lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu qu\u2019elle avait commis une inconduite.\n[6] Avant que l\u2019appel de la prestataire puisse aller de l\u2019avant, je dois d\u00e9cider s\u2019il a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Autrement dit, il doit y avoir une cause d\u00e9fendableNote de bas de page 1. Si l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s, l\u2019affaire est closeNote de bas de page 2.\n[7] Je ne suis pas convaincue que l\u2019appel a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la prestataire la permission d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec son appel.\nQuestions en litige [8] Voici les questions en litige :\na) Peut-on soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a omis d\u2019appliquer la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi ou les principes du droit du travail? b) Est-il possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019est une inconduite? c) Est-il possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait importante?\nJe ne donne pas \u00e0 la prestataire la permission de faire appel [9] La permission de faire appel est refus\u00e9e lorsque la division d\u2019appel est convaincue que l\u2019appel n\u2019a aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Il y a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s s\u2019il est possible que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de comp\u00e9tence, de proc\u00e9dure, de droit ou un certain type d\u2019erreur de faitNote de bas de page 3.\n[10] Pour ce type d\u2019erreur de fait, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit avoir fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une erreur commise de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire, ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissanceNote de bas de page 4.\nLa prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait omis d\u2019appliquer la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi [11] La prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a omis d\u2019appliquer la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi ou les principes du droit du travail.\n[12] La prestataire affirme qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9. Elle dit que la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi et les principes du droit du travail s\u2019appliquent.\n[13] Toutefois, la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi et les principes du droit du travail ne sont pas pertinents pour d\u00e9cider si une partie prestataire a commis une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[14] Les tribunaux ont toujours affirm\u00e9 que, dans le contexte du r\u00e9gime d\u2019assurance-emploi, les principes du droit du travail et de la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi ne s\u2019appliquent pas. Ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est restreint lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9valuer l\u2019inconduite. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit se concentrer sur la question de savoir si ce que le membre du personnel a fait ou omis de faire constitue une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 5.\n[15] Il existe d\u2019autres voies en dehors du contexte de l\u2019assurance-emploi que les employ\u00e9es et les employ\u00e9s peuvent suivre pour toute violation des lois du travail ou de la Loi sur les normes d\u2019emploi, y compris pour cong\u00e9diement injustifi\u00e9.\nLa prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qui constitue une inconduite [16] La prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019est une inconduite.\n[17] La prestataire nie avoir commis une inconduite. Elle soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019est une inconduite. Elle affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas inconduite dans les circonstances suivantes :\nSi une employ\u00e9e est en mesure de remplir ses fonctions sans avoir \u00e0 se faire vacciner. La prestataire affirme que les exigences de vaccination de l\u2019employeur n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec son travail. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait capable d\u2019effectuer son travail sans avoir \u00e0 se faire vacciner. Lorsque la politique de l\u2019employeur est ill\u00e9gale, inconstitutionnelle ou d\u00e9raisonnable. Elle dit qu\u2019on ne devrait pas exiger d\u2019une employ\u00e9e qu\u2019elle se conforme \u00e0 une politique ill\u00e9gale ou d\u00e9raisonnable. Elle affirme que son employeur s\u2019immis\u00e7ait dans des choix tr\u00e8s personnels touchant son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle. Lorsqu\u2019un employeur peut offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e. La prestataire affirme que la politique de son employeur \u00e9tait draconienne. Elle dit que son employeur aurait d\u00fb lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation, plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle fasse quelque chose avec lequel elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord.\nUne inconduite peut survenir m\u00eame si l\u2019employeur met en place une nouvelle politique qui ne fait pas partie du contrat de travail initial ou de la description d\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne [18] La prestataire affirme que la vaccination ne faisait pas partie de ses obligations d\u2019emploi. Essentiellement, elle affirme que ses obligations d\u2019emploi \u00e9taient d\u00e9finies par son contrat initial et sa description de travail. Elle dit que si son contrat de travail et sa description de travail ne l\u2019obligeaient pas \u00e0 se faire vacciner, le fait qu\u2019elle a choisi de ne pas se faire vacciner ne constitue pas une inconduite.\n[19] Cependant, il est maintenant bien \u00e9tabli que les politiques et les exigences d\u2019un employeur n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 faire partie du contrat de travail ou de la description de travail pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduite.\n[20] Au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont rendu plusieurs d\u00e9cisions concernant des membres du personnel qui n\u2019ont pas respect\u00e9 les politiques de vaccination de leur employeur respectif. Dans chaque cas, aucun des contrats de travail originaux ou des descriptions de travail n\u2019exigeait la vaccination contre la COVID-19. Pourtant, les tribunaux \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter qu\u2019il y ait eu inconduite lorsque les membres du personnel n\u2019ont pas respect\u00e9 les politiques de vaccination de leur employeur.\n[21] Par exemple, dans l\u2019affaire Matti, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire que la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur soit incluse dans l\u2019entente initiale, car [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019inconduite peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e par rapport aux politiques qui surviennent apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la relation d\u2019emploi \u00bbNote de bas de page 6.\n[22] Dans le cas de KukNote de bas de page 7, M. Kuk a choisi de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur. La politique ne faisait pas partie de son contrat de travail. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu qu\u2019il y avait inconduite parce que M. Kuk ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur et qu\u2019il savait quelles seraient les cons\u00e9quences s\u2019il ne s\u2019y conformait pas.\n[23] Dans les affaires CecchettoNote de bas de page 8et MilovacNote de bas de page 9, la vaccination ne faisait pas partie de la convention collective ou du contrat de travail. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que m\u00eame ainsi, il y avait inconduite lorsque les appelants ne respectaient pas les politiques de vaccination de leur employeur.\n[24] Il y a aussi de nombreux cas en dehors du contexte des politiques de vaccination qui montrent que les politiques d\u2019un employeur n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 faire partie du contrat de travail ou de la description d\u2019emploi d\u2019une partie prestataire pour qu\u2019il y ait inconduiteNote de bas de page 10. La politique de vaccination a introduit une autre exigence ou une obligation que la prestataire avait envers l\u2019employeur.\nLa l\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou le caract\u00e8re raisonnable d\u2019une politique n\u2019est pas pertinent pour la question de l\u2019inconduite [25] La prestataire affirme que la politique de vaccination de son employeur \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, inconstitutionnelle et d\u00e9raisonnable. Par exemple, elle dit que son employeur a enfreint la Loi sur la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail avec sa politique de vaccination. Pour cette raison, elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 se conformer \u00e0 la politique.\n[26] Elle affirme que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb examiner la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 et le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la politique. Elle affirme que si elle l\u2019avait fait, elle aurait conclu que la politique de son employeur \u00e9tait \u00e0 la fois ill\u00e9gale et d\u00e9raisonnable. Pour cette raison, elle affirme qu\u2019elle aurait conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tenue de se conformer \u00e0 la politique.\n[27] Toutefois, les arguments concernant la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 et le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la politique de vaccination d\u2019un employeur ne sont pas pertinents pour la question de l\u2019inconduite. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et la division d\u2019appel n\u2019ont pas le pouvoir de traiter ce type d\u2019arguments. Dans l\u2019affaire Cecchetto, la Cour a \u00e9crit :\nComme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il est probable que le demandeur [Cecchetto] sera frustr\u00e9 par ce r\u00e9sultat, parce que mes motifs ne portent pas sur les questions juridiques, \u00e9thiques et factuelles fondamentales qu\u2019il soul\u00e8ve. Il en est ainsi parce que bon nombre de ces questions d\u00e9bordent tout simplement le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9raisonnable pour un d\u00e9cideur de ne pas tenir compte d\u2019arguments de droit qui ne s\u2019inscrivent pas dans la mission qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la loi.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et la division d\u2019appel [du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale] ont un r\u00f4le important \u00e0 jouer au sein du syst\u00e8me judiciaire, mais ce r\u00f4le est limit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9cis. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ce r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les raisons pour lesquelles le demandeur [Cecchetto] avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si ces raisons constituaient une \u00ab inconduite \u00bb [\u2026]\nMalgr\u00e9 les arguments du demandeur, il n\u2019y a pas de fondement pour annuler la d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9, la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 ou la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de la directive no 6 ni rendu de d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce sujet. Ce genre de conclusion ne relevait pas du mandat ou de la comp\u00e9tence de la division d\u2019appel ni de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. [Citation omiseNote de bas de page 11]\n[C\u2019est moi qui souligne]\n[28] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et la division d\u2019appel [traduction] \u00ab ne sont pas les instances appropri\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir si la politique [de l\u2019employeur] ou le cong\u00e9diement [de l\u2019employ\u00e9] \u00e9tait raisonnable \u00bbNote de bas de page 12.\n[29] Je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019il est possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019est une inconduite lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur.\nLe fait qu\u2019un employeur n\u2019ait pas offert de mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 la question de l\u2019inconduite [30] La prestataire fait valoir que son employeur aurait pu lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation plut\u00f4t que de la cong\u00e9dier parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vaccin\u00e9e.\n[31] Toutefois, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019obligation d\u2019un employeur d\u2019offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u2019est pas pertinente pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 13.\n[32] Je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019il soit possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu\u2019est une inconduite si elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 si l\u2019employeur de la prestataire aurait pu lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation au lieu de la cong\u00e9dier.\nLa prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis des erreurs de fait importantes [33] La prestataire n\u2019a pas de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis des erreurs de fait importantes sur la question de savoir si elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant des cons\u00e9quences du non-respect de la politique de vaccination de son employeur.\n[34] La prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu qu\u2019elle savait que son employeur la cong\u00e9dierait si elle ne respectait pas sa politique. Elle nie qu\u2019elle savait que son employeur pouvait la cong\u00e9dier.\n[35] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9crit :\n[\u2026] la [prestataire] a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle savait que si elle ne respectait pas la politique de vaccination de l\u2019employeur, elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e (page GD3-31 du dossier d\u2019appel)Note de bas de page 14.\n[36] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a cern\u00e9 la preuve qui montrait que la prestataire savait qu\u2019elle risquait d\u2019\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[37] Les conclusions de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concordent avec la preuve. En plus du document de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires de la Commission (page GD3-31 du dossier d\u2019appel), l\u2019employeur de la prestataire a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission qu\u2019il l\u2019avait inform\u00e9e de ses exigences en mati\u00e8re de vaccination.

H., est admissible \u00e0 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Les versements commencent au mois de novembre 2020. J\u2019explique dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision pourquoi j\u2019accueille l\u2019appel.\nAper\u00e7u [3] L\u2019appelante a 50 ans. Les seuls emplois r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a occup\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 des postes d\u2019ouvri\u00e8re dans des usines. En 2006, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir de la douleur aux \u00e9paules, aux poignets, \u00e0 la main, \u00e0 la hanche droite, aux genoux, aux chevilles et aux pieds. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler pendant plusieurs p\u00e9riodes. En 2016, elle a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde active. Encore une fois, elle a pris des cong\u00e9s au besoin. Son dernier emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 celui de [traduction] \u00ab manutentionnaire de marchandises \u00bb (ou emballeuse) pour une entreprise de v\u00eatements. Elle a occup\u00e9 cet emploi de septembre 2016 \u00e0 juin 2020, au moment o\u00f9 elle a quitt\u00e9 l\u2019emploi en raison de douleurs et d\u2019autres limitations. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas pu travailler depuis en raison des limitations caus\u00e9es par la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde.\n[4] L\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada le 26 octobre 2021. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision du ministre devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\n[5] L\u2019appelante affirme que sa pouss\u00e9e de polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde s\u2019est poursuivie depuis juin 2020. Elle affirme que c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle elle ne peut occuper aucun emploi et qu\u2019elle a souvent de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019occuper de ses besoins personnels. Elle a dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019aime pas ne pas travailler et qu\u2019elle retournerait au travail si ses sympt\u00f4mes s\u2019am\u00e9lioraient.\n[6] Le ministre affirme que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas grave parce qu\u2019elle est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement capable d\u2019accomplir certaines t\u00e2ches. Le ministre dit aussi que son sp\u00e9cialiste pense que sa polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde entrera en r\u00e9mission [traduction] \u00ab et lui permettra ainsi de retourner au travail \u00bb.\nCe que l\u2019appelante doit prouver [7] Pour obtenir gain de cause, l\u2019appelante doit prouver qu\u2019elle avait une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2023. Autrement dit, au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2023. Cette date est fond\u00e9e sur ses cotisations au R\u00e9gime de pensions du CanadaNote de bas de page 1. Elle doit aussi prouver qu\u2019elle continue d\u2019\u00eatre invalideNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] Le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada d\u00e9finit les termes \u00ab grave \u00bb et \u00ab prolong\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[9] Une invalidit\u00e9 est grave si elle rend la partie appelante r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement incapable de d\u00e9tenir une occupation v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9mun\u00e9ratriceNote de bas de page 3.\n[10] Cela signifie que je dois examiner l\u2019ensemble des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante pour voir quel effet ils ont sur sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler. Je dois \u00e9galement tenir compte de facteurs tels que son \u00e2ge, son niveau de scolarit\u00e9 et son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle et personnelle. Ainsi, je pourrai obtenir un portrait r\u00e9aliste de la gravit\u00e9 de son invalidit\u00e9. Si l\u2019appelante est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement capable d\u2019effectuer un travail qui lui permettrait de gagner sa vie, elle n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9.\n[11] Une invalidit\u00e9 est prolong\u00e9e si elle doit vraisemblablement durer pendant une p\u00e9riode longue, continue et ind\u00e9finie ou doit entra\u00eener vraisemblablement le d\u00e9c\u00e8sNote de bas de page 4.\n[12] Cela signifie que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante ne peut \u00eatre assortie d\u2019une date pr\u00e9vue de r\u00e9tablissement. Il faut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 emp\u00eache l\u2019appelante de travailler pendant une longue p\u00e9riode.\n[13] L\u2019appelante doit prouver qu\u2019elle a une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e. Elle doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019elle est invalide.\nMotifs de ma d\u00e9cision [14] Je conclus que l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une invalidit\u00e9 grave et prolong\u00e9e au mois de juin 2020. Elle continue d\u2019\u00eatre invalide. J\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les questions suivantes :\nL\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle grave? L\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle prolong\u00e9e?\nL\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle grave? [15] L\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait grave de fa\u00e7on continue. J\u2019en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cette conclusion en tenant compte de plusieurs facteurs. J\u2019explique ces facteurs plus loin.\nLes limitations fonctionnelles de l\u2019appelante ont nui \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler [16] L\u2019appelante est atteinte de polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde active. Elle a d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 dont je parlerai plus loin. Toutefois, je ne peux pas me concentrer sur les diagnostics de l\u2019appelanteNote de bas de page 5. Je dois plut\u00f4t me demander si elle a des limitations fonctionnelles qui l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de gagner sa vieNote de bas de page 6. Dans le cadre de cette d\u00e9marche, je dois examiner tous les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante (pas seulement le probl\u00e8me principal) et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 leur incidence sur sa capacit\u00e9 de travaillerNote de bas de page 7.\n[17] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelante a des limitations fonctionnelles qui nuisaient \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler.\nCe que l\u2019appelante dit au sujet de ses limitations fonctionnelles [18] L\u2019appelante affirme que ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 ont entra\u00een\u00e9 des limitations fonctionnelles qui affectent sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler.\n[19] Je crois ce que dit l\u2019appelante au sujet de ses limitations fonctionnelles et que, si elle pouvait travailler, elle le ferait. La preuve m\u00e9dicale montre que l\u2019appelante a travaill\u00e9 pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019apparition de ses sympt\u00f4mes. Avant de cesser compl\u00e8tement de travailler en juin 2020, elle avait des p\u00e9riodes de pouss\u00e9es de douleur, d\u2019enflure et d\u2019engourdissement dans les articulations. Elle a aussi eu des p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9mission ou des pouss\u00e9es plus l\u00e9g\u00e8res. Les p\u00e9riodes pendant lesquelles elle a travaill\u00e9 et n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 correspondent \u00e0 la description de son \u00e9tat et de ses sympt\u00f4mes d\u00e9crits dans la preuve m\u00e9dicale.\n[20] L\u2019appelante affirme que, depuis qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler en juin 2020, elle a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des pouss\u00e9es de polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde qui lui causent les probl\u00e8mes suivantsNote de bas de page 8 :\nIl lui arrive de ne pas pouvoir sortir du lit. Sa main droite lui fait tellement mal et tellement souvent qu\u2019il lui arrive de ne pas pouvoir se laver sans aide. Parfois, ses plus jeunes enfants qui ont 12 ans ne peuvent pas aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole parce qu\u2019ils doivent rester \u00e0 la maison pour prendre soin d\u2019elle. Elle souffre de douleurs chroniques, d\u2019enflure et d\u2019engourdissements aux \u00e9paules, aux bras, \u00e0 la main droite, au cou, aux chevilles, aux genoux.\n[21] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 que certains sympt\u00f4mes se sont aggrav\u00e9s depuis qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler en juin 2020. Elle raconte qu\u2019auparavant sa main droite lui causait des probl\u00e8mes. Non [sic], elle a des probl\u00e8mes aux deux mains en raison du syndrome du canal carpien et de la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde. Elle doit porter des attelles aux mains la nuit. Elle dit qu\u2019elle ne peut pas ouvrir ses flacons de pilules.\n[22] L\u2019appelante a \u00e9galement dit que, si elle marche trop, sa cheville droite enfle et, pendant les jours qui suivent, elle ne peut pas se tenir debout ou marcher, et doit se reposer.\n[23] L\u2019appelante a une tendinite aux \u00e9paules et un disque du cou qui enfle p\u00e9riodiquement en raison de la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde. Si elle utilise trop son \u00e9paule droite, le lendemain, elle ne peut pas utiliser son bras droit et ne doit utiliser que son bras gauche.\nCe que la preuve m\u00e9dicale r\u00e9v\u00e8le au sujet des limitations fonctionnelles de l\u2019appelante [24] L\u2019appelante doit fournir une preuve m\u00e9dicale d\u00e9montrant que ses limitations fonctionnelles nuisaient \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de travailler au plus tard le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2023Note de bas de page 9. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9taye les propos de l\u2019appelante. Je ne donnerai pas les d\u00e9tails de la preuve m\u00e9dicale.\n[25] En juin 2016, une \u00e9chographie de son \u00e9paule gauche a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffrait d\u2019une tendinite du sus-\u00e9pineux et du subscapulaireNote de bas de page 10.\n[26] En juillet 2016, elle a consult\u00e9 un rhumatologue pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que ses douleurs articulaires ont commenc\u00e9 en 2006 et qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient s\u00e9v\u00e8res depuis un mois. Il a \u00e9galement dit qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de novembre 2015, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir des douleurs r\u00e9currentes aux \u00e9paules, aux poignets, aux mains, \u00e0 la hanche droite, aux genoux, aux chevilles et aux pieds. Il a dit qu\u2019elle avait chaque semaine des \u00e9pisodes de douleur intense qui duraient de 2 \u00e0 3 jours. Il a aussi dit que les sympt\u00f4mes se sont aggrav\u00e9s en raison d\u2019une activit\u00e9 excessive. Il a dit qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait probablement atteinte de polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde s\u00e9ropositive et qu\u2019il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui faire prendre des m\u00e9dicamentsNote de bas de page 11.\n[27] Entre 2016 et 2020, l\u2019appelante a travaill\u00e9 parce que sa polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde \u00e9tait en r\u00e9mission ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait que de l\u00e9g\u00e8res pouss\u00e9esNote de bas de page 12. Elle prenait des cong\u00e9s quand elle en avait besoin. Toutefois, en janvier 2020, sa polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde est redevenue active et \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une inflammation \u00e0 la main droite, au cou, aux genoux, aux chevilles et, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion, aux coudes. Le matin, elle avait des raideurs qui pouvaient durer une heureNote de bas de page 13.\n[28] Depuis janvier 2020, ses sympt\u00f4mes sont constamment mauvaisNote de bas de page 14. Le formulaire de rapport m\u00e9dical rempli par son m\u00e9decin de famille indique qu\u2019en raison de ses d\u00e9ficiences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde elle ne peut pas marcher ou se tenir debout pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes et a de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se laver et \u00e0 s\u2019habillerNote de bas de page 15.\n[29] J\u2019examinerai ensuite la question de savoir si l\u2019appelante a suivi les conseils des m\u00e9decins.\nL\u2019appelante a suivi les conseils des m\u00e9decins [30] Pour recevoir une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, la partie appelante doit suivre les conseils des m\u00e9decinsNote de bas de page 16. L\u2019appelante a suivi les conseils des m\u00e9decinsNote de bas de page 17. Le ministre ne soutient pas le contraire, et la preuve montre clairement qu\u2019elle a suivi les conseils des m\u00e9decins.\n[31] Je dois maintenant d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante peut occuper sur une base r\u00e9guli\u00e8re d\u2019autres types d\u2019emploi. Pour pouvoir \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de graves, les limitations fonctionnelles de l\u2019appelante doivent emp\u00eacher cette derni\u00e8re de gagner sa vie dans n\u2019importe quel type d\u2019emploi, pas seulement dans son emploi habituelNote de bas de page 18.\nL\u2019appelante ne peut pas travailler dans un contexte r\u00e9aliste [32] Pour d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante peut travailler, je ne peux pas simplement examiner ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et leur incidence sur ses capacit\u00e9s. Je dois \u00e9galement tenir compte des facteurs suivants :\nson \u00e2ge; son niveau de scolarit\u00e9; ses capacit\u00e9s linguistiques; son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle et personnelle.\n[33] Ces facteurs m\u2019aident \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante peut travailler dans un contexte r\u00e9aliste, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire s\u2019il est r\u00e9aliste de dire qu\u2019elle peut travaillerNote de bas de page 19. Je conclus que l\u2019appelante ne peut pas travailler dans un contexte r\u00e9aliste. L\u2019appelante est incapable de travailler depuis juin 2020.\n[34] L\u2019appelante a 50 ans et a donc plusieurs ann\u00e9es avant d\u2019atteindre l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite. Elle parle couramment l\u2019anglais. Elle a \u00e9galement obtenu un dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales d\u2019assistante dentaire en 1994, mais elle n\u2019a jamais occup\u00e9 un emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 dans ce domaine. Elle a dit qu\u2019elle avait tent\u00e9 d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience b\u00e9n\u00e9vole en tant qu\u2019assistante dentaire, mais qu\u2019elle avait des probl\u00e8mes avec ses mains pour faire ce travail.\n[35] La seule exp\u00e9rience de travail r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans des usines. Elle n\u2019a jamais occup\u00e9 d\u2019emploi de bureau. Je conclus qu\u2019elle n\u2019est m\u00eame pas physiquement capable de se recycler et d\u2019obtenir un emploi de bureau. Ses limitations sont trop s\u00e9v\u00e8res et fr\u00e9quentes pour la rendre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement capable de faire des t\u00e2ches de bureau ou de se recycler. Il lui arrive r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de ne pas pouvoir sortir du lit, s\u2019habiller et s\u2019occuper de son hygi\u00e8ne quotidienne sans aide. En raison de la douleur et de l\u2019enflure dans ses mains, caus\u00e9es par la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde, et maintenant le syndrome du canal carpien, elle ne pouvait pas se servir d\u2019un ordinateur.\n[36] Je conclus que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait grave au mois de juin 2020.\nL\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait-elle prolong\u00e9e? [37] L\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante \u00e9tait prolong\u00e9e.\n[38] Le principal probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019appelante, la polyarthrite rhumato\u00efde, a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois en juillet 2016, mais les sympt\u00f4mes ont commenc\u00e9, \u00e0 divers degr\u00e9s, avant cela. Depuis qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u son diagnostic, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de travailler pendant des p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9mission ou des pouss\u00e9es plus l\u00e9g\u00e8res. Toutefois, depuis qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler en juin 2020, elle n\u2019a pas pu travailler. C\u2019est ce qui ressort clairement de la preuve m\u00e9dicale et de ce que dit l\u2019appelante. Elle est donc invalide de fa\u00e7on continue depuis plus de trois ans.\n[39] Le ministre affirme qu\u2019avec un traitement optimal continu, son rhumatologue estimait que sa maladie pourrait entrer en r\u00e9mission une fois de plus. La preuve m\u00e9dicale ne corrobore pas les propos du ministre.\n[40] L\u2019appelante pourrait entrer en r\u00e9mission partielle ou substantielle. Cela ne veut pas dire que son invalidit\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liorera suffisamment pour qu\u2019elle soit r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement capable de travailler. Ce n\u2019est pas non plus quelque chose qui pourrait se produire dans un avenir pr\u00e9visible.

Le Tribunal est en partie en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019appelantNote de bas de page 1.\n[2] Dans cet appel, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur avait mis l'appelant en cong\u00e9 sans solde pour cause d\u2019inconduite.\n[3] Dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, la Commission a toutefois prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi en avril 2022 pour cause d\u2019inconduite. Autrement dit, l\u2019appelant a fait quelque chose qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son cong\u00e9diement.\n[4] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant n\u2019est pas admissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement. C\u2019est ce que la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9. La Commission avait donc rendu la bonne d\u00e9cision relativement \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019assurance-emploi.\nAper\u00e7u [5] L\u2019appelant s\u2019est vu imposer un cong\u00e9 sans solde par son employeur \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2021. L\u2019employeur l\u2019a ensuite cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en date du 22 avril 2022. La Commission affirme que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cong\u00e9 puis cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas respect\u00e9 la politique de son employeur en mati\u00e8re de vaccination obligatoire contre la COVID-19 (politique de vaccination).\n[6] La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la raison de sa suspension et de son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une inconduite, selon la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Pour cette raison, la Commission n\u2019a pas pu verser \u00e0 l\u2019appelant des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 compter du 5 juin 2022Note de bas de page 2.\n[7] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu puis cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nQuestions que je dois examiner en premier L\u2019appel de l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [8] L\u2019appelant a d'abord fait appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en juin 2023. Il contestait une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 12 octobre 2022. Une personne dispose d\u2019un d\u00e9lai de 30 jours pour faire appel apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u communication de la d\u00e9cisionNote de bas de page 3. Toutefois, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019accorder plus de temps, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un maximum d\u2019un an, lorsqu\u2019est fournie une explication jug\u00e9e acceptableNote de bas de page 4.\n[9] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 les raisons fournies par l\u2019appelant et n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 son appel tardif. L\u2019appelant a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel.\n[10] Le membre de la division d\u2019appel, lui, a conclu que l\u2019appelant avait fourni une raison acceptable pour son retard. Le membre a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019appel soit renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour qu\u2019une audience soit tenue.\n[11] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est le r\u00e9sultat de cette audience.\nLe Tribunal n\u2019accepte pas les liens ou les pi\u00e8ces jointes dans des dossiers partag\u00e9s en ligne ni les hyperliens [12] Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2023, l\u2019appelant a partag\u00e9 un lien menant \u00e0 un tweet. Il a aussi inclus un lien vers un compte Google Drive, o\u00f9 se trouverait un contrat sign\u00e9 par le gouvernement pour l\u2019achat de vaccins.\n[13] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019appelant le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2023, en expliquant qu\u2019il n\u2019accepte pas les liens ou les pi\u00e8ces jointes partag\u00e9s au moyen de dossiers partag\u00e9s en ligne ou d\u2019hyperliensNote de bas de page 5.\n[14] Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience. L\u2019appelant a reconnu avoir re\u00e7u l\u2019avis expliquant que les liens et les documents partag\u00e9s en ligne ne sont pas admissibles.\n[15] L\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9mis d\u2019inqui\u00e9tude \u00e0 ce sujet pendant l\u2019audience.\n[16] Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 7 d\u00e9cembre 2023, l\u2019appelant s\u2019est vu offert la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires dans un format acceptable. Cette option lui a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. L\u2019appelant a toutefois choisi de ne rien pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autre.\n[17] L\u2019appelant a toutefois parl\u00e9 de cette preuve lors de l\u2019audience. Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de douter de ce que contenaient les liens. Comme l\u2019explique la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, l\u2019appelant a fait preuve de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9. J\u2019ai donc tenu compte de la preuve que l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e verbalement pendant l\u2019audience.\nQuestion en litige [18] L\u2019appelant a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu puis cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour cause d\u2019inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi?\nAnalyse [19] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi, une personne ne peut pas recevoir de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi si elle perd son emploi pour inconduite. La r\u00e8gle s\u2019applique qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un cong\u00e9diement ou d\u2019une suspension.\n[20] Je dois \u00e9tablir deux choses, \u00e0 savoir :\nLa raison pour laquelle l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu puis cong\u00e9di\u00e9; Si cette raison est une inconduite selon la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[21] Un employ\u00e9 qui perd son emploi \u00e0 cause de son \u00ab inconduite \u00bb n\u2019est pas admissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi. Dans ce contexte, une \u00ab inconduite \u00bb renvoie \u00e0 la violation d\u2019une condition d\u2019emploi.\nRaison de la suspension et du cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019appelant [22] Je conclus que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu et cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par son employeur parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 sa politique de vaccination.\n[23] L\u2019appelant et la Commission conviennent que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu le 1er novembre 2021. Les deux parties conviennent \u00e9galement que l\u2019appelant a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le 22 avril 2022, et ce, pour non-respect de la nouvelle politique de vaccination obligatoire. Cependant, les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la question de l\u2019inconduite.\n[24] Rien ne me permet de croire que l\u2019appelant soit au ch\u00f4mage pour une autre raison. Il n\u2019y a rien au dossier ni dans son t\u00e9moignage qui me fasse douter de cette conclusion. Je conclus, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve dont je dispose, que l\u2019appelant ne travaille plus pour l\u2019employeur parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 sa politique de vaccination.\nLa raison du cong\u00e9diement est-elle une inconduite selon la loi? [25] Je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi dans le cas du cong\u00e9 sans solde de l'appelant. Je conclus cependant qu\u2019il y a inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi dans le cas de son renvoi ou cong\u00e9diement. Les paragraphes qui suivent pr\u00e9sentent mon analyse.\nInconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi [26] La Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi ne pr\u00e9cise pas ce qu\u2019est une inconduite. Ce sont les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux qui \u00e9tablissent le crit\u00e8re juridique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inconduite. Ce crit\u00e8re sp\u00e9cifie les types de faits et de questions que je dois examiner pour rendre ma d\u00e9cision.\n[27] La Commission doit prouver qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour inconduite, et non pour une autre raisonNote de bas de page 6.\n[28] Je dois m\u2019attarder \u00e0 ce que l\u2019appelant a fait ou n\u2019a pas fait, et \u00e9tablir si cet agissement est une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploiNote de bas de page 7. Je ne peux pas juger de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la politique de l\u2019employeur, ni de la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la suspension ou du cong\u00e9diement \u00e0 titre de cons\u00e9quenceNote de bas de page 8.\n[29] Une intention coupable n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente chez l\u2019appelant. Autrement dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il ait eu l\u2019intention de faire quelque chose de mal pour que sa conduite soit jug\u00e9e comme une inconduiteNote de bas de page 9. Pour \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une inconduite, sa conduite doit \u00eatre d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire consciente, voulue ou intentionnelleNote de bas de page 10. Une inconduite comprend aussi une conduite qui est si insouciante qu\u2019elle est presque d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9eNote de bas de page 11.\n[30] Il y a inconduite si l\u2019appelant savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que sa conduite pouvait l\u2019emp\u00eacher de remplir ses obligations envers son employeur et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement possible qu\u2019il soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour cette raisonNote de bas de page 12.\n[31] Mon pouvoir se limite \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a eu inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Je ne peux pas baser ma d\u00e9cision sur d\u2019autres loisNote de bas de page 13. Je ne peux pas me prononcer sur la question de savoir si son cong\u00e9diement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait de mani\u00e8re constructive ou s\u2019il \u00e9tait injustifi\u00e9 au regard du droit du travail. Je ne peux pas interpr\u00e9ter un contrat de travail ni d\u00e9cider si l\u2019employeur a enfreint une convention collectiveNote de bas de page 14. Je ne peux pas non plus d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de son employeur, ou si celui-ci aurait d\u00fb lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation en vertu des droits de la personneNote de bas de page 15. Enfin, je ne peux pas non plus d\u00e9cider si un employeur a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e ou \u00e0 d\u2019autres droits de l\u2019appelant dans le contexte de son emploi, ou autrement.\nVersions des faits de la Commission et de l\u2019appelant [32] La Commission affirme qu\u2019il y a eu inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, puisque la preuve d\u00e9montre ce qui suit :\nL\u2019employeur avait une politique de vaccination dont tout le personnel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9; Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique de vaccination, tout le personnel devait s\u2019y conformer, sans quoi une suspension ou un cong\u00e9diement \u00e9taient possibles; Une demande d\u2019exemption devait obligatoirement \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le personnel ne souhaitant pas se faire vacciner. Cette demande devait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur; L\u2019appelant savait ce qu\u2019il devait faire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique; Il savait \u00e9galement que son employeur pouvait le mettre en cong\u00e9 sans solde ou le cong\u00e9dier pour non-respect de la politique; L\u2019employeur a d\u2019abord suspendu l\u2019appelant sans solde, puis l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en date du 22 avril 2022, parce qu\u2019il ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 sa politique de vaccination.\n[33] L\u2019appelant d\u00e9fend qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi,pour les raisons suivantes :\nL\u2019appelant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019exemption relative \u00e0 la vaccination le 19 septembre 2021Note de bas de page 16. Sa demande a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e le 28 septembre 2021Note de bas de page 17; Il a fourni des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires le 4 octobre 2021Note de bas de page 18; Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu le 1er novembre 2021Note de bas de page 19. Sa demande d\u2019exemption \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Il fait valoir qu\u2019il respectait la politique en date du 1er novembre 2021; Sa demande d\u2019exemption a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e le 8 novembre 2021Note de bas de page 20. Le probl\u00e8me, c\u2019est qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu sans solde; Le gouvernement avait reconnu, \u00e0 l\u2019achat de vaccins, que leurs effets \u00e0 long terme et leur efficacit\u00e9 demeuraient incertainsNote de bas de page 21. Il se demande comment le gouvernement peut aider les employeurs en refusant de leur verser des prestations pour un vaccin non \u00e9prouv\u00e9; D\u2019autres ont re\u00e7u des prestations. Il a cit\u00e9 le tweet d\u2019une personne qui avait gagn\u00e9 son appelNote de bas de page 22; L\u2019appelant fait \u00e9galement valoir qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en avril 2022 et que l\u2019employeur a convenu que son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait sans motif.\n[34] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans le pr\u00e9sent appel sont coh\u00e9rents et clairs. Je crois et j\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019appelant et celle de la Commission.\n[35] Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de mettre en doute la preuve de l\u2019appelant, soit ce qu\u2019il a dit \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e9crit dans sa demande de r\u00e9vision et son avis d\u2019appel, et son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Son t\u00e9moignage est coh\u00e9rent. Il n\u2019y a pas de preuve qui contredise ce qu\u2019il a dit.\n[36] J\u2019accepte la preuve de la Commission parce qu\u2019elle concorde avec la preuve de l\u2019appelant. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la preuve n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e. Comme membre du Tribunal, je dois rendre une d\u00e9cision selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Ici, la preuve est claire. Les parties sont d\u2019accord sur les faits. J\u2019accepte donc la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les deux parties.\n[37] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 remplir est la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. C\u2019est ce crit\u00e8re juridique que le Tribunal doit examiner. La Commission a prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de la politique, qu\u2019il connaissait les cons\u00e9quences du non-respect de la politique, et qu\u2019il a continu\u00e9 de ne pas s\u2019y conformer en sachant qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre suspendu et cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Son comportement \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Ses actions \u00e9taient conscientes, voulues ou intentionnelles.\n[38] Je juge que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas d\u2019intention coupable. La preuve ne permet pas une telle constatation. N\u00e9anmoins, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le crit\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inconduite repose sur le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019agissement. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prouver une intention coupable.\n[39] De nouveaux jugements appuient ce principe. Dans une cause r\u00e9cente appel\u00e9e Parmar,Note de bas de page 23 la Cour devait se prononcer sur la question de savoir si un employeur \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre une employ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 sans solde parce qu\u2019elle ne respectait pas une politique de vaccination obligatoire. Madame Parmar ne voulait pas recevoir le vaccin parce qu\u2019elle avait des doutes quant \u00e0 son efficacit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme et \u00e0 ses effets n\u00e9fastes sur la sant\u00e9.\n[40] Dans cette affaire, la Cour a reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab extraordinaire d\u2019adopter une politique touchant l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle d\u2019une employ\u00e9e \u00bb, tout en statuant que la politique de vaccination en question \u00e9tait raisonnable au regard des [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9fis sanitaires extraordinaires pos\u00e9s par la pand\u00e9mie mondiale de COVID-19. \u00bb La Cour a ajout\u00e9 ceci :\n[154] [. . .] [Les politiques de vaccination obligatoire] n\u2019obligent pas les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 se faire vacciner. Elles les obligent plut\u00f4t \u00e0 choisir entre se faire vacciner et continuer \u00e0 gagner un revenu, ou rester non vaccin\u00e9s et perdre leur revenu ...\n[41] La jurisprudence a confirm\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence limit\u00e9e du Tribunal, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a convenu dans une autre affaire r\u00e9cente, en janvier 2023, que le Tribunal a un pouvoir limit\u00e9Note de bas de page 24. Apr\u00e8s un passage \u00e0 la Commission, ce dossier s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal. La division d\u2019appel avait ensuite maintenu la d\u00e9cision. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ensuite proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une r\u00e9vision, et statu\u00e9 comme suit au paragraphe 32 de son jugement :\n[traduction] [32] M\u00eame s\u2019il est manifeste que le demandeur est frustr\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun des d\u00e9cideurs n\u2019a trait\u00e9 des questions fondamentales de droit et de fait qu\u2019il estime soulever, notamment en ce qui concerne l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 corporelle, le consentement aux tests m\u00e9dicaux, l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des vaccins contre la COVID-19 ou les tests antig\u00e9niques, la d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel n\u2019en est pas moins raisonnable. Le principal probl\u00e8me avec l\u2019argumentaire du demandeur, c\u2019est qu\u2019il reproche aux d\u00e9cideurs de ne pas avoir trait\u00e9 d\u2019un ensemble de questions sur lesquelles la loi, en fait, ne les autorise pas \u00e0 se prononcer.\n[42] Selon l\u2019appelant, il faut tenir compte du fait que le gouvernement a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prouv\u00e9 que les vaccins \u00e9taient s\u00e9curitaires ou efficaces. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment trait\u00e9 de cette question dans une de ses d\u00e9cisionsNote de bas de page 25. Dans cette cause, le demandeur soutenait que l\u2019innocuit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du vaccin n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9esNote de bas de page 26. Nous parlerons de la d\u00e9cision Cecchetto.\n[43] Dans Cecchetto, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel, \u00e0 savoir que la loi ne permettait pas au Tribunal de traiter de ces questions. La Cour a convenu qu\u2019en faisant un choix personnel et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur, le demandeur avait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ses obligations et perdu son emploi pour cause d\u2019inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. La Cour a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe d\u2019autres instances dans le syst\u00e8me judiciaire o\u00f9 le demandeur pouvait adresser ses revendications.\n[44] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est pench\u00e9e dans une autre d\u00e9cision sur le refus d\u2019une personne \u00e0 se faire vaccinerNote de bas de page 27. Le demandeur, dans cette affaire, travaillait \u00e0 temps plein de son domicile, et s\u2019\u00e9tait vu refuser une exemption en vertu du Code des droits de la personne. Voici ce qu\u2019on peut lire au paragraphe 32 du jugement :\n[traduction] [32] Tout comme dans l\u2019affaire Cecchetto, le demandeur connaissait les cons\u00e9quences du non-respect de la politique, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9es dans les multiples communications du R\u00e9seau universitaire de sant\u00e9. Le demandeur avait aussi eu de nombreuses occasions de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. Le demandeur savait que sa demande d\u2019exemption avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Dans ce contexte, il a commis une inconduite volontaire en d\u00e9cidant volontairement de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la politique.\n[45] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne tire aucune conclusion quant \u00e0 la validit\u00e9 de la politique ou \u00e0 toute violation possible aux droits de l\u2019appelant en vertu d\u2019autres lois.\n[46] Je suis d\u2019accord que l\u2019appelant peut refuser de se faire vacciner. Cette d\u00e9cision lui revient. C\u2019est son droit. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord que l\u2019employeur doit assurer le bon fonctionnement du milieu de travail, ce qui suppose de concevoir et d\u2019appliquer des politiques en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail. L\u2019employeur a la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir un milieu de travail s\u00e9curitaire.\n[47] Je ne peux pas non plus tenir compte du fait que l\u2019employeur affirme que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 sans motif. L\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mal intentionn\u00e9. La preuve dont je dispose ne me laisse pas croire le contraire. Le crit\u00e8re juridique \u00e0 remplir est la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Selon la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et la jurisprudence, l\u2019appelant a rempli les crit\u00e8res pour une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nSuspension \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2021 [48] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, je conclus que la Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu pour cause d\u2019inconduite. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelant affirme qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant de la politique. Il savait qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre suspendu s\u2019il ne s\u2019y conformait pas.\n[49] Toutefois, l\u2019appelant affirme qu\u2019il respectait alors toujours la politique. Il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019exemption. Il avait ensuite fourni des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits.\n[50] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 la lettre lui refusant l\u2019exemptionNote de bas de page 28. Elle est dat\u00e9e du 28 septembre 2021. Il est clair que sa demande d\u2019exemption avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Toutefois, la lettre pr\u00e9cise aussi que l\u2019employeur n\u2019est pas en mesure de lui accorder une exemption pour le moment. La lettre informe \u00e9galement l\u2019appelant qu\u2019il dispose d\u2019un d\u00e9lai d\u2019une semaine pour fournir d\u2019autres renseignements. L\u2019appelant a effectivement fourni des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires dans le d\u00e9lai d\u2019une semaine qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offertNote de bas de page 29. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un courriel dat\u00e9 du 4 octobre 2021.\n[51] L\u2019appelant explique avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2021. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d\u2019\u00eatre suspendu. Il avait l\u2019impression que sa demande \u00e9tait toujours \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude. Il ne savait pas qu\u2019il serait suspendu.\n[52] Je crois l\u2019appelant. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de douter des d\u00e9clarations qu\u2019il a faites \u00e0 la Commission. Rien ne me permet de douter de ses t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[53] Pour cette raison, je conclus que l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessitant qu\u2019il sache ou devait savoir qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre suspendu n\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent. Ainsi, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu pour cause d\u2019inconduite.\n[54] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, les suspensions peuvent avoir une date de fin. Aux termes de l\u2019article 31 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi, un prestataire qui est suspendu de son emploi en raison de son inconduite n\u2019est pas admissible au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations jusqu\u2019\u00e0, selon le cas :\na) la fin de la p\u00e9riode de suspension; b) la perte de cet emploi ou son d\u00e9part volontaire; c) le cumul chez un autre employeur, depuis le d\u00e9but de cette p\u00e9riode, du nombre d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable exig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 ou 7.1.\n[55] Pour cette raison, l\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 qui aurait pu s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019appelant prendrait fin au moment de son cong\u00e9diement. Autrement dit, l\u2019article 31(b) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi s\u2019appliquerait. Toutefois, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je conclus que l\u2019appelant n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inadmissible.\nCong\u00e9diement \u00e0 compter du 22 avril 2022 [56] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve, je conclus que la Commission a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait inconduite dans le cas du cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019appelant, comme elle a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant :\nsavait que son employeur pouvait le cong\u00e9dier s\u2019il ne respectait pas sa politique de vaccination; savait que sa demande d\u2019exemption avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e; a consciemment, d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment ou intentionnellement pris la d\u00e9cision personnelle de ne pas se conformer \u00e0 la politique de vaccination de son employeur; a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la politique de vaccination de son employeur.\n[57] L\u2019appelant soutient ne pas avoir commis d\u2019inconduite. Il se fonde en partie sur le fait que l\u2019employeur avait confirm\u00e9 un cong\u00e9diement sans motif. Je conviens que l\u2019appelant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mal intentionn\u00e9. Il demeure toutefois que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 observer est celui de Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[58] L\u2019appelant a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il savait qu\u2019il pouvait \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 s\u2019il ne respectait pas la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait lu la lettre du 8 novembre 2021 l\u2019informant que sa demande d\u2019exemption avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Cette lettre sp\u00e9cifie clairement que les personnes ne s\u2019y conformant pas pourraient \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9es.\n[59] Contrairement \u00e0 sa suspension, j\u2019estime, dans le cas du cong\u00e9diement, que l\u2019appelant savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9 s\u2019il ne respectait pas la politique de vaccination de son employeur. Celle-ci sp\u00e9cifie que les personnes non vaccin\u00e9es n\u2019ayant pas obtenu d\u2019exemption pourraient \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9es. Cette pr\u00e9cision figure dans la politique ainsi que dans la lettre qui l\u2019informait du rejet de sa demande d\u2019exemption. Cette lettre est dat\u00e9e du 8 novembre 2021.\n[60] Je comprends que l\u2019appelant ne soit pas d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9cision. N\u00e9anmoins, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale me dit que je peux seulement suivre le sens ordinaire de la loi. Je ne peux pas r\u00e9\u00e9crire la loi ou la modifier de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 obtenir un r\u00e9sultat qui semblerait plus \u00e9quitable pour l\u2019appelantNote de bas de page 30.\nConclusion [61] La Commission n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu en raison d\u2019une inconduite au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[62] La Commission a prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison d\u2019une inconduite en date du 22 avril 2022. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appelant est exclu du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations \u00e0 compter de cette date.

L., la requ\u00e9rante, a demand\u00e9 une pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC) le 22 septembre 2022. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a approuv\u00e9 la demande de la requ\u00e9rante. Celle-ci a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir une pension mensuelle de 270,74 $ \u00e0 compter d\u2019octobre 2022.\n[3] La requ\u00e9rante a demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision parce qu\u2019elle pensait que sa pension aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e compte tenu des ann\u00e9es durant lesquelles elle avait travaill\u00e9 au Canada et de l\u2019augmentation du co\u00fbt de la vie. Le ministre a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision. La requ\u00e9rante a fait appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que le ministre avait calcul\u00e9 la pension de retraite de la requ\u00e9rante selon les r\u00e8gles. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a constat\u00e9 aucune erreur dans les calculs du ministre.\nQuestions en litige [5] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait-elle avoir commis une erreur qui justifierait de donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel? b) La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9sente-t-elle, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [6] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si sa demande montre qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 1.\n[7] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019erreur d\u00e9fendable commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [9] La requ\u00e9rante soutient que le montant de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada est trop faible. Selon elle, elle devrait toucher entre 550 $ et 800 $ par mois. Dans le calcul qu\u2019elle a fourni pour appuyer sa position, elle \u00e9nonce d\u2019abord une [traduction] \u00ab estimation du revenu de travail \u00bb.

Elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 le calcul pr\u00e9vu par le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, ait commis une erreurNote de bas de page 5.\nLa requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019a pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale [13] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

Par cons\u00e9quent, son appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant au sujet de la date \u00e0 laquelle doit commencer le versement de sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] S. N. (requ\u00e9rant) a \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9 au printemps 2015. Le 7 mars 2017, il a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Le ministre a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9vision.\n[3] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022, le requ\u00e9rant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Cette fois-ci, le ministre a accueilli sa demande de pension et conclu qu\u2019il y \u00e9tait admissible. Le requ\u00e9rant a malgr\u00e9 tout demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision, parce qu\u2019il voulait que le versement de sa pension commence plus t\u00f4t. Le ministre n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision.\n[4] Le requ\u00e9rant a fait appel au Tribunal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 son appel, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que le versement de sa pension doit commencer en mars 2021.\nQuestions en litige [5] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait-elle pu commettre une erreur de droit dans sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 commence la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du requ\u00e9rant? b) Le requ\u00e9rant pr\u00e9sente-t-il, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qui pourraient justifier la permission de faire appel?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [6] Je peux accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 1.\n[7] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui pourraient justifier de lui accorder la permission de faire appel, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de droit quant \u00e0 l\u2019ouverture de sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de droit du fait qu\u2019elle ne lui a pas accord\u00e9 de paiements remontant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re demande [9] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur relativement \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 doit commencer sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Selon lui, voici ce qui importe pour le versement de sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 :\nIl est invalide depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 en 2015; Il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 invalide en 2017, quand il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, et le ministre a fait une erreur en rejetant sa demande. Il n\u2019avait pas les moyens de faire appel.Note de bas de page 3\n[10] Le requ\u00e9rant ne soul\u00e8ve pas une cause d\u00e9fendable en affirmant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de droit parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas calcul\u00e9 le d\u00e9but de sa pension en fonction des bonnes dates. La date o\u00f9 commence le versement de la pension ne d\u00e9pend pas de la date o\u00f9 il est devenu invalide ni de celle de sa premi\u00e8re demande.\n[11] Ce qui importe, ici, c\u2019est la date o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sa deuxi\u00e8me demande. C\u2019est cette deuxi\u00e8me demande qui a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une r\u00e9vision du ministre, et celle pour laquelle le ministre a \u00e9crit une lettre attestant la r\u00e9vision. Cette demande du requ\u00e9rant est donc la seule demande que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pouvait examiner pour \u00e9tablir la date d\u2019ouverture de sa pensionNote de bas de page 4.\n[12] Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, aux fins du versement de la pension, un requ\u00e9rant peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme invalide au maximum 15 mois avant la pr\u00e9sentation de sa demande. Il y a ensuite un d\u00e9lai de carence de quatre mois \u00e0 observer avant le versement des prestations. Le requ\u00e9rant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande en f\u00e9vrier 2022. En reculant de 15 mois, on arrive \u00e0 novembre 2020. Compte tenu du d\u00e9lai de carence de quatre mois, sa pension pouvait donc \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de mars 2021Note de bas de page 5.\n[13] Je peux comprendre que le requ\u00e9rant trouve logique que ses paiements remontent \u00e0 la date de sa premi\u00e8re demande de pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. Toutefois, il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le pouvoir de lui verser sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 aussi t\u00f4t. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait suivre la loi et examiner la demande dont elle \u00e9tait d\u00fbment saisie, \u00e0 savoir sa deuxi\u00e8me demande. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la date \u00e0 laquelle il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette deuxi\u00e8me demande, puis a conclu que sa pension lui serait vers\u00e9e aussit\u00f4t que la loi l\u2019autorisait, soit d\u00e8s mars 2021.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de faire une demande [14] Le versement d\u2019une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 peut commencer plus t\u00f4t si le requ\u00e9rant d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de former ou d\u2019exprimer l\u2019intention d\u2019en faire la demande plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a faitNote de bas de page 6. Dans un tel cas, pour le versement de la pension, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale peut consid\u00e9rer la demande comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e durant l'incapacit\u00e9.\n[15] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur dans son analyse concernant l\u2019incapacit\u00e9. Le requ\u00e9rant affirme simplement qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas les moyens de faire appel du premier refus du ministre. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale s\u2019est bas\u00e9e sur la preuve disponible et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de former ou d\u2019exprimer l\u2019intention de faire une demande, et ce, m\u00eame si ses capacit\u00e9s cognitives n\u2019\u00e9taient plus les m\u00eames depuis sa crise \u00e9pileptique de mai 2021Note de bas de page 7.\n[16] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 une erreur de droit d\u00e9fendable. Je ne peux donc pas lui donner la permission de faire appel sur ce fondement.\nLa nouvelle preuve n\u2019est pas pertinente pour la question en litige [17] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel, le requ\u00e9rant a fourni une nouvelle note m\u00e9dicale dat\u00e9e du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2023Note de bas de page 8. La note pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il est un bon candidat \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, et que sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 marcher et \u00e0 \u00eatre debout est tr\u00e8s restreinte et l\u2019emp\u00eache d\u2019occuper tout emploi. La note pr\u00e9cise que son accident a eu lieu le 15 avril 2015.\n[18] Le requ\u00e9rant est d\u00e9j\u00e0 admissible \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. La lettre du m\u00e9decin confirme quand il est devenu invalide. Cependant, rien dans cette lettre ne permet de tirer une conclusion diff\u00e9rente quant au moment o\u00f9 sa pension doit commencer, conform\u00e9ment R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Comme ce nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 la question en litige, qui est de savoir quand doit d\u00e9buter le versement de sa pension, cette preuve ne peut pas justifier d\u2019accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel.\nConclusion [19] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel concernant le d\u00e9but de sa pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir les articles 58.1(a) et (b) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 58.1(c) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir cette d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision aux pages AD1C-2 et AD1C-3 du dossier d\u2019appel. \u00c0 la page AD1C-1, le requ\u00e9rant soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas les moyens de faire appel de cette d\u00e9cision.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir l\u2019article 82 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, qui signifie que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale examine les appels form\u00e9s contre des d\u00e9cisions que le ministre a rendues apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision. C\u2019est pour la deuxi\u00e8me demande du requ\u00e9rant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.

Une p\u00e9riode de prestations a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au 16 octobre 2022.\n[3] Au moment de d\u00e9poser sa demande de prestations, le nombre de semaines maximales en prestations de maladie qui pouvait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 \u00e9tait de 15 semaines. Pendant que le prestataire recevait des prestations, la disposition de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE) fixant le nombre de semaines maximales en prestations de maladie a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e. \u00c0 compter du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2022, le nombre de semaines maximales allou\u00e9 est de 26 semaines.\n[4] Le 20 mars 2023, l\u2019appelante (Commission) a avis\u00e9 le prestataire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir des prestations pour la dur\u00e9e maximale en prestations pr\u00e9vues au moment o\u00f9 il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations. Elle a donc indiqu\u00e9 au prestataire qu\u2019il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 recevoir 15 semaines en prestations de maladie. Le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord car il \u00e9tait toujours dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de retourner travailler \u00e0 cause de sa maladie.\n[5] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision, la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. Le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[6] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations avant que la Loi sur l\u2019AE soit modifi\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire \u00e9tait dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de travailler jusqu\u2019au 15 avril 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le changement \u00e0 la loi est survenu pendant que le prestataire recevait des prestations de maladie. Le prestataire pouvait donc recevoir des prestations pendant 26 semaines.\n[7] La permission d\u2019en appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission. Elle soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en droit.\n[8] Je dois d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que le prestataire avait droit \u00e0 26 semaines de prestations de maladie.\n[9] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel de la Commission.\nQuestion en litige [10] Est-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que le prestataire avait droit \u00e0 26 semaines de prestations de maladie?\nAnalyse Mandat de la division d\u2019appel [11] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la division d\u2019appel n\u2019avait d\u2019autre mandat que celui qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par les articles 55 \u00e0 69 de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.Note de bas de page 1\n[12] La division d\u2019appel agit \u00e0 titre de tribunal administratif d\u2019appel eu \u00e9gard aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et n\u2019exerce pas un pouvoir de surveillance de la nature de celui qu\u2019exerce une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[13] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'ait pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, qu'elle ait err\u00e9 en droit ou qu'elle ait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ousans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, je dois rejeter l'appel.\nEst-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que le prestataire avait droit \u00e0 26 semaines de prestations de maladie ? [14] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de prestations avant que la Loi sur l\u2019AE soit modifi\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire \u00e9tait dans l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de travailler jusqu\u2019au 15 avril 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le changement \u00e0 la loi est survenu pendant que le prestataire recevait des prestations de maladie. Le prestataire pouvait donc recevoir des prestations pendant 26 semaines.\n[15] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande de prestations de maladie avant le changement \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019AE prolongeant les prestations de maladie, de 15 \u00e0 26 semaines.\n[16] Selon la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les lois ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme ayant une port\u00e9e r\u00e9troactive \u00e0 moins que le texte de la loi ne le d\u00e9cr\u00e8te express\u00e9ment ou n\u2019exige implicitement une telle interpr\u00e9tation.Note de bas de page 2\n[17] Il y a effet r\u00e9troactif lorsqu\u2019une loi nouvelle s\u2019applique de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 prescrire le r\u00e9gime juridique de faits enti\u00e8rement accomplis avant son entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\n[18] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, il est manifeste que la loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas express\u00e9ment que la loi est r\u00e9troactive. Comme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il n\u2019existe aucune disposition transitoire ou texte pr\u00e9voyant que la modification s\u2019applique aux demandes de prestations de maladie \u00e9tablies ant\u00e9rieurement au changement \u00e0 la loi.\n[19] Est-ce que le texte de loi exige implicitement une telle interpr\u00e9tation?\n[20] Je ne le crois pas.\n[21] La Loi sur l'AE d\u00e9finit une demande initiale de prestations comme une demande formul\u00e9e aux fins d\u2019\u00e9tablir une p\u00e9riode de prestations au profit du prestataire.Note de bas de page 3\n[22] L\u2019article 12 indique qu\u2019\u00abune fois la p\u00e9riode de prestations \u00e9tablie, des prestations peuvent, \u00e0 concurrence des maximums pr\u00e9vus au pr\u00e9sent article, \u00eatre vers\u00e9es au prestataire pour chaque semaine de ch\u00f4mage comprise dans cette p\u00e9riode.\u00bbNote de bas de page 4\n[23] Au moment o\u00f9 le prestataire a \u00e9tabli sa p\u00e9riode de prestations, le maximum pr\u00e9vu \u00e9tait de 15 semaines. Il est devenu 26 semaines \u00e0 partir du 18 d\u00e9cembre 2022.Note de bas de page 5\n[24] Le texte de loi n\u2019exige pas implicitement une interpr\u00e9tation r\u00e9troactive. Au contraire, la Loi sur l\u2019AE pr\u00e9voit sp\u00e9cifiquement que le maximum de semaines est celui applicable au moment de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[25] Le texte de loi sugg\u00e8re plut\u00f4t un effet imm\u00e9diat de la loi qui s\u2019applique aux moments o\u00f9 elle prend effet, soit les demandes de prestations de maladie \u00e9tablies au 18 d\u00e9cembre 2022 ou apr\u00e8s.\n[26] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a donc commis une erreur de droit en concluant que le prestataire \u00e9tait en droit de recevoir 26 semaines de prestations de maladie.\n[27] Je suis donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir.\nRem\u00e8de [28] Le dossier devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tant complet, je suis en mesures de rendre la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[29] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande de prestations de maladie avant le changement \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019AE prolongeant les prestations de maladie, de 15 \u00e0 26 semaines.\n[30] Pour avoir droit \u00e0 26 semaines de prestations de maladie, la demande de prestations doit \u00eatre \u00e9tablie au 18 d\u00e9cembre ou apr\u00e8s, date du changement de la Loi sur l\u2019AE.\n[31] Malgr\u00e9 la sympathie que j\u2019\u00e9prouve pour le prestataire, la Loi ne permet pas de prolonger la p\u00e9riode maximale de prestations de maladie, et n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ni \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel, le pouvoir d\u2019accorder une prolongation de cette p\u00e9riode, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment des circonstances particuli\u00e8res entourant la situation d\u2019un prestataire.\n[32] Il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel de la Commission.\nConclusion [33] L\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Jean, 2015 CAF 242; Maunder c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 274.\nNote de bas de page 2\nGustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. c Ministre du Revenu national, [1977] 1 R.C.S. 271.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir article 6(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 4\nArticle 12(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\nNote de bas de page 5\nArticle 12(3) c) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi.\n",

L\u2019appelante a aussi demand\u00e9 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s environ neuf ans plus tard. Le ministre a rejet\u00e9 cette demande parce que la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 la partie mise en cause. L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du ministre en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLe R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada pr\u00e9voit qui est admissible \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019une personne d\u00e9c\u00e8de. Le ministre doit verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la succession de toute personne cotisante d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e. Cependant, il y a trois exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La r\u00e8gle ne s\u2019applique pas dans les trois situations suivantes :\n\u00b7 Le ministre a conclu, apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate raisonnable, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de succession.\n\u00b7 La succession n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande dans les 60 jours suivant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la cotisante ou du cotisant.\n\u00b7 Le montant de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est inf\u00e9rieur au \u00ab montant prescrit \u00bb.\nSi l\u2019une de ces exceptions s\u2019applique, le ministre peut alors verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la personne ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement qui a pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires ou qui en est responsable, mais seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant des frais fun\u00e9raires. Si le montant de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est sup\u00e9rieur aux frais fun\u00e9raires, ce qui reste peut alors \u00eatre vers\u00e9 \u00e0 la survivante ou au survivant de la personne cotisante, ou \u00e0 son plus proche parent. Le pouvoir du ministre dans ce cas-ci est discr\u00e9tionnaire : il peut verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 une autre partie plut\u00f4t que de la verser \u00e0 la succession de la personne cotisante.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019une des exceptions s\u2019appliquait. Le montant de la prestation \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur au montant prescrit. Comme une exception s\u2019appliquait, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le ministre avait le droit de verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant des frais fun\u00e9raires, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement qui avait pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la facture fournie par la partie mise en cause, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le ministre avait raisonnablement conclu que la partie mise en cause avait pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires ou en \u00e9tait responsable. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel. Elle a conclu que l\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de C.

[Traduction] \u00ab Automobiles \u00bb \u00e9tait la seule d\u00e9pense indiqu\u00e9e sur la facture, pour un total de 339 $Note de bas de page 6. Elle a \u00e9galement soumis deux factures de X pour le terrain du cimeti\u00e8re, la pierre tombale et l\u2019inhumation. Ces deux factures totalisaient 5 593,50 $Note de bas de page 7.\n[8] Le ministre a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019appelante puisqu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vers\u00e9 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la mise en cause. L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du ministre en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\nCe que je dois d\u00e9cider [9] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante est admissible \u00e0 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nCe que dit la loi [10] Le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada pr\u00e9cise qui a droit \u00e0 une prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s lorsqu\u2019une personne d\u00e9c\u00e8de. Par d\u00e9faut, la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est payable aux ayants droit de la personne cotisante d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9eNote de bas de page 8. Il existe n\u00e9anmoins trois exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Dans les trois situations suivantes, la r\u00e8gle ne s\u2019applique pasNote de bas de page 9 :\na) Le ministre est convaincu, apr\u00e8s enqu\u00eate raisonnable, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019ayants droit; b) Les ayants droit n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s dans les 60 jours suivant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la personne cotisante; c) Le montant de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est inf\u00e9rieur au \u00ab montant prescrit \u00bb.\n[11] Si l\u2019une de ces exceptions s\u2019applique, le ministre peut verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la personne ou \u00e0 l\u2019organisme qui a pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires ou qui est responsable de les payer, mais seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant des frais fun\u00e9rairesNote de bas de page 10. Ensuite, si la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s est sup\u00e9rieure aux frais fun\u00e9raires, le reste de la prestation peut \u00eatre vers\u00e9 au survivant ou au plus proche parent de la personne cotisanteNote de bas de page 11.\n[12] Le ministre a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 une personne autre que les ayants droit de la personne cotisante. Il n\u2019en a pas l\u2019obligation. Autrement dit, le ministre peut utiliser ce pouvoir, mais n\u2019y est pas oblig\u00e9. S\u2019il utilise ce pouvoir, il doit le faire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire. Autrement dit, le ministre ne doit pas :\nagir de mauvaise foi; agir dans un but ou pour un motif irr\u00e9gulier (pour une mauvaise raison); tenir compte d\u2019un facteur non pertinent; ignorer un facteur pertinent; discriminerNote de bas de page 12.\nMotifs de ma d\u00e9cision [13] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle s\u2019appliquait. Le montant de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur au montant prescrit. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la date du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de C. B., le \u00ab montant prescrit \u00bb de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 2 387 $Note de bas de page 13. Le ministre a calcul\u00e9 le montant r\u00e9el de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 57(1) du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, comme il \u00e9tait tenu de le faire. Il a ainsi calcul\u00e9 que la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s r\u00e9elle \u00e9tait de 556,50 $Note de bas de page 14, soit un montant inf\u00e9rieur au montant prescrit de 2 387 $.\n[14] Comme une exception s\u2019appliquait, le ministre pouvait verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence du montant des frais fun\u00e9raires, \u00e0 l\u2019organisme ayant pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la facture soumise par la mise en cause, le ministre a raisonnablement conclu que la mise en cause avait pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires ou \u00e9tait responsable de les payer.\n[15] La prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieure au montant des frais fun\u00e9raires. Le ministre a donc vers\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 de la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la mise en cause. Il ne restait plus rien \u00e0 payer au survivant ou au plus proche parent de C. B., y compris l\u2019appelante.\n[16] Le ministre a suivi les r\u00e8gles du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en utilisant son pouvoir pour verser la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 la mise en cause.\n[17] De plus, le ministre a agi judiciairement. Rien ne prouve que le ministre aurait agi de mauvaise foi, dans un but ou pour un motif irr\u00e9gulier ou de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. Rien ne prouve qu\u2019il aurait tenu compte d\u2019un facteur non pertinent ou ignor\u00e9 un facteur pertinent. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le ministre ne disposait d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve laissant croire que la mise en cause n\u2019avait pas pay\u00e9 les frais fun\u00e9raires indiqu\u00e9s sur la facture qu\u2019elle avait fournie, ou qu\u2019une autre personne (comme l\u2019appelante) aurait \u00e9galement pay\u00e9 des frais fun\u00e9raires.\n[18] Lorsque le ministre a effectivement vers\u00e9 la prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s, comme il l\u2019a fait dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il n\u2019est pas tenu de la verser \u00e0 quiconque pourrait la demander plus tardNote de bas de page 15.\nConclusion [19] Je conclus que l\u2019appelante n\u2019est pas admissible \u00e0 une prestation de d\u00e9c\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de C.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] A. G. (le requ\u00e9rant) vit au Canada depuis octobre 2016. Il a demand\u00e9 une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en octobre 2021. Dans sa demande de pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, il a demand\u00e9 que le versement de sa pension commence le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n[3] Pour recevoir une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, une partie prestataire doit avoir au moins 65 ans, r\u00e9sider l\u00e9galement au Canada et y avoir v\u00e9cu pendant au moins 10 ansNote de bas page 1. Si une partie prestataire n\u2019a pas r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pendant 10 ans, elle peut tout de m\u00eame recevoir une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse si elle a v\u00e9cu dans un ou plusieurs pays qui ont conclu des accords en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale avec le Canada. Ces accords peuvent aider les parties prestataires \u00e0 remplir l\u2019exigence de r\u00e9sidence de 10 ans. Toutefois, les ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9sidence dans d\u2019autres pays au titre de ces accords ne sont pas compt\u00e9es dans le calcul du montant de la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesseNote de bas page 2.\n[4] Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a conclu qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant avait v\u00e9cu au Canada, \u00e0 Sainte-Lucie et \u00e0 Antigua-et-Barbuda au titre d\u2019accords en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale, il avait droit \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse au taux de 4\/40e.\n[5] Le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser le montant de sa pension, mais le ministre n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 son calcul apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision.\n[6] Le requ\u00e9rant a donc fait appel au Tribunal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel du requ\u00e9rant, concluant que le ministre n\u2019avait commis aucune erreur dans le calcul de la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse du requ\u00e9rant. Les ann\u00e9es additionnelles o\u00f9 le requ\u00e9rant a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 dans des pays avec lesquels le Canada a conclu des accords en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ont permis au requ\u00e9rant de remplir les conditions requises pour recevoir une pension partielle, mais ces ann\u00e9es n\u2019augmentent pas le montant de sa pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Le requ\u00e9rant a soulev\u00e9 d\u2019autres questions concernant le processus de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, qui ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es ou r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nQuestions en litige [7] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) Est-il possible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur qui justifierait que j\u2019accorde au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [8] Je peux accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande soul\u00e8ve un argument d\u00e9fendable selon lequel la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a :\nomis de suivre une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou refus\u00e9 de les exercer; commis une erreur de droit; commis une erreur de fait; commis une erreur en appliquant la loi aux faitsNote de bas page 3.\n[9] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel si la demande pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 4.\n[10] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 un argument d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis une erreur [11] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 sa preuve au sujet de la mauvaise information fournie par le site Web du ministre. Le site Web d\u00e9crit comment le ministre d\u00e9cide qui est admissible \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse et comment la r\u00e9sidence d\u00e9terminera le montant de cette pension.\n[12] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient \u00e9galement que la justice naturelle exigerait que le ministre conc\u00e8de (ou que la division d\u2019appel accueille l\u2019appel) parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas compris la loi sur la fa\u00e7on dont le ministre calcule les pensions partielles dans sa situation avant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne l\u2019expliqueNote de bas page 5.\n[13] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis une erreur. Il croyait que ses ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger ne seraient pas simplement prises en compte dans le calcul de son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Il pensait que ces ann\u00e9es augmenteraient le montant de la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse qu\u2019il recevrait. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le requ\u00e9rant a compris comment fonctionnent les r\u00e8gles sur la r\u00e9sidence et les pensions partielles de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb reconna\u00eetre qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal inform\u00e9 au sujet des pensions partielles de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse par l\u2019information publi\u00e9e sur le site Web du ministre.\n[14] Toutefois, il est impossible de soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait le pouvoir de tenir compte du fait que le requ\u00e9rant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mal inform\u00e9 au sujet de la loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne peut pas commettre une erreur en ignorant la preuve concernant le site Web.\n[15] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale doit appliquer la loi sur le calcul des pensions partielles de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse exactement telle qu\u2019elle est \u00e9crite, peu importe ce que le requ\u00e9rant en a compris. Si le requ\u00e9rant a \u00e9t\u00e9 mal inform\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la loi, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019augmenter le montant de sa pension partielle en cons\u00e9quence.\n[16] Je ne peux pas donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel. Il n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 aucun argument d\u00e9fendable voulant que le ministre ait mal calcul\u00e9 sa pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\n[17] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la preuveNote de bas page 6. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a calcul\u00e9 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en fonction des ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 le requ\u00e9rant a v\u00e9cu au Canada et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger au titre des accords en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale pertinents.\n[18] L\u2019appel du requ\u00e9rant soulevait d\u2019importantes pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de son exp\u00e9rience avec Service Canada, tant en ce qui concerne les lettres et les demandes qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues que les renseignements qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de trouver sur son site Web. Toutefois, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de se pencher sur ces exp\u00e9riences.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve [19] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ainsi, aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne pourrait constituer la raison pour laquelle la permission de faire appel serait accord\u00e9e.\nConclusion [20] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 la permission de faire appel.

Il est admissible \u00e0 recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 compter de ce moment.\nAper\u00e7u [3] Le 28 juillet 2023, l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019assurance-emploi. Il a alors expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il d\u00e9tenait un permis de travail lui permettant de travailler au Canada pour l\u2019employeur X, mais qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper son emploi le 7 juillet 2023.\n[4] Le 17 octobre 2023, la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada (la Commission) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019appelant est inadmissible aux prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi \u00e0 compter du 9 juillet 2023 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible pour travailler. Elle pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir fait des d\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour se trouver un emploi et qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient un permis de travail restreint.\n[5] Pour recevoir des prestations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi, l\u2019appelant doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler. La disponibilit\u00e9 est une exigence continue. Cela signifie que l\u2019appelant doit \u00eatre \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi.\n[6] L\u2019appelant fait valoir qu\u2019il est disponible pour travailler et qu\u2019il souhaite se trouver un emploi. Il indique qu\u2019il a fait plusieurs d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un autre emploi depuis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied chez X.\n[7] Je dois d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant est disponible pour travailler. L\u2019appelant doit le prouver selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cela signifie qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019il \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler.\nQuestion en litige [8] L\u2019appelant est-il disponible pour travailler \u00e0 compter du 9 juillet 2023 ?\nAnalyse D\u00e9marches habituelles et raisonnables pour trouver un emploi [9] Le droit \u00e9nonce les crit\u00e8res que je dois consid\u00e9rer pour d\u00e9terminer si les d\u00e9marches de l\u2019appelant sont habituelles et raisonnables.Note de bas de page 1 Je dois d\u00e9terminer si ces d\u00e9marches sont soutenues et si elles visent \u00e0 trouver un emploi convenable. Autrement dit, l\u2019appelant doit avoir pers\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher un emploi convenable.\n[10] Je dois aussi \u00e9valuer les d\u00e9marches que l\u2019appelant a faites pour se trouver un emploi. Le R\u00e8glement pr\u00e9sente une liste de neuf activit\u00e9s de recherche d\u2019emploi que je dois consid\u00e9rer, commeNote de bas de page 2 :\n\u00e9valuer les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi; r\u00e9diger un curriculum vitae ou une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation; s\u2019inscrire \u00e0 des outils de recherche d\u2019emploi, des banques d\u2019emploi en ligne ou aupr\u00e8s de bureaux de placement; communiquer avec des employeurs \u00e9ventuels; pr\u00e9senter des demandes d\u2019emploi.\n[11] La Commission fait valoir que le permis de travail dont dispose l\u2019appelant limite ind\u00fbment ses chances de se trouver un emploi puisqu\u2019il le restreint \u00e0 travailler pour le seul employeur indiqu\u00e9 sur le permis.\n[12] De plus, elle soutient que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fourni de preuve d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il a r\u00e9ellement fait les d\u00e9marches dites pour obtenir un permis de travail ouvert.\n[13] La Commission affirme \u00e9galement que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fait de d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi actives et soutenues. Elle soutient que m\u00eame si l\u2019appelant soutient avoir fait des d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi, il n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019indiquer le nom d\u2019une personne \u00e0 qui il aurait parl\u00e9 ou la date \u00e0 laquelle il aurait sollicit\u00e9 les employeurs mentionn\u00e9s.\n[14] L\u2019appelant explique que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que la Commission fait valoir et m\u00eame s\u2019il d\u00e9tient un permis de travail restreint, il a fait plusieurs d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi.\n[15] Il explique qu\u2019il a d\u2019ailleurs d\u2019abord amorc\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches pour obtenir un permis de travail ouvert. Sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, mais il a contest\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision. Il attend toujours les r\u00e9sultats de cette d\u00e9marche. Pendant ce temps, il explique qu\u2019il a contact\u00e9 plusieurs employeurs pour solliciter un emploi. Il souhaite qu\u2019un employeur accepte de lui offrir un permis de travail. Il mentionne d\u2019ailleurs avoir quitt\u00e9 son pays d\u2019origine pour travailler au Canada.\n[16] Le 9 septembre 2023, l\u2019appelant a fourni \u00e0 la Commission une liste des employeurs qu\u2019il aurait sollicit\u00e9s soit par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou en personne. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, il mentionne les employeurs : McDonald\u2019s, Sobeys ou Altium.Note de bas de page 3\n[17] Lorsqu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son avis d\u2019appel, il a \u00e9galement transmis une copie d\u2019un \u00e9change de courriels prouvant qu\u2019il avait bel et bien sollicit\u00e9 les employeurs mentionn\u00e9s.Note de bas de page 4\n[18] Lors de l\u2019audience, l\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 que depuis le 9 septembre 2023, il a continu\u00e9 ses d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi. Son repr\u00e9sentant qui l\u2019accompagnait lors de l\u2019audience a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il est superviseur chez X et, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019employeur a d\u00fb mettre \u00e0 pied l\u2019appelant en raison d\u2019une baisse des besoins op\u00e9rationnels, il souhaite le soutenir et l\u2019aider dans ses d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un autre emploi. Il explique qu\u2019il accompagne l\u2019appelant dans chacune de ses d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un emploi et qu\u2019il prend le temps d\u2019expliquer aux employeurs que l\u2019appelant a besoin d\u2019un permis de travail. Il explique que certains employeurs sont ouverts \u00e0 cette proc\u00e9dure.\n[19] L\u2019appelant explique que ces d\u00e9marches sont difficiles \u00e0 faire, mais il assure qu\u2019il veut travailler, qu\u2019il souhaite travailler et qu\u2019il en est capable. Il indique qu\u2019il est venu d\u2019Ha\u00efti pour am\u00e9liorer son sort et qu\u2019il doit aussi subvenir aux besoins de sa famille.\n[20] Comme il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu lors de l\u2019audience, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le dossier de la Commission d\u00e9montrait les d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il avait faites entre le 9 juillet 2023 et le 9 septembre 2023, l\u2019appelant a transmis au Tribunal la liste des employeurs qu\u2019il aurait sollicit\u00e9s depuis le 9 septembre 2023.\n[21] Selon ce document, l\u2019appelant a sollicit\u00e9 14 employeurs depuis le 9 septembre 2023. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, il se serait d\u00e9plac\u00e9 en personne chez : Walmart, Dollorama et Village des valeurs.Note de bas de page 5 L\u2019appelant sollicite un emploi comportant une autre fonction que celle mentionn\u00e9e sur son permis de travail restreint puisque, comme il l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, il souhaite qu\u2019un employeur accepte de lui offrir un permis de travail selon la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un poste qu\u2019il peut occuper. Ainsi, il se dit pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler comme caissier, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entretien m\u00e9nager, vendeur ou apprenti m\u00e9canicien.\n[22] Ainsi, les faits d\u00e9montrent que depuis le 9 juillet 2023, l\u2019appelant a fait des d\u00e9marches autant pour modifier son permis de travail que pour se trouver un emploi.\n[23] Bien s\u00fbr, ces d\u00e9marches sont difficiles pour l\u2019appelant dont la langue maternelle est le cr\u00e9ole, mais il a un accompagnateur dans ses d\u00e9marches et il pers\u00e9v\u00e8re.\n[24] Les explications fournies lors de l\u2019audience ainsi que le document transmis au Tribunal apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience me convainquent que l\u2019appelant a non seulement le d\u00e9sir de travailler, mais qu\u2019il fait les d\u00e9marches qui sont \u00e0 sa disposition en ce sens.\n[25] Je conclus que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa disponibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 compter du 9 juillet 2023.\nCapable de travailler et disponible pour le faire [26] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 examiner pour d\u00e9terminer si un prestataire est capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire, mais incapable de trouver un emploi convenable. L\u2019appelant doit prouver les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivantsNote de bas de page 6 :\nmontrer qu\u2019il veut retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable lui est offert; faire des d\u00e9marches pour trouver un emploi convenable; d\u00e9montrer l\u2019absence de conditions personnelles qui limiteraient ind\u00fbment (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qui limiteraient trop) ses chances de retourner travailler.\n[27] Au moment d\u2019examiner chacun de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je dois prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019attitude et la conduite de l\u2019appelant.Note de bas de page 7\nVouloir retourner travailler [28] La Commission soutient que l\u2019appelant n\u2019avait pas le d\u00e9sir imm\u00e9diat de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le march\u00e9 du travail. Elle explique qu\u2019un prestataire doit d\u00e9montrer la volont\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate de mettre fin \u00e0 sa p\u00e9riode de ch\u00f4mage le plus rapidement possible et que l\u2019appelant devait d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi. Ce qui, selon elle, n\u2019est pas le cas.\n[29] L\u2019appelant soutient qu\u2019il souhaite se trouver un autre emploi depuis qu\u2019il a cess\u00e9 de travailler pour X. Il indique qu\u2019il a fait des d\u00e9marches pour modifier le permis de travail restreint qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de et qu\u2019il souhaite avoir la chance de trouver un employeur qui accepte de l\u2019embaucher.\n[30] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019appelant avait le d\u00e9sir et qu\u2019il a toujours le d\u00e9sir de retourner sur le march\u00e9 du travail d\u00e8s que possible.\n[31] L\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il voulait retourner travailler aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019un emploi convenable lui serait offert. Je dois maintenant \u00e9valuer s\u2019il a effectu\u00e9 des d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi concr\u00e8tes pour se trouver un emploi.Note de bas de page 8\nFaire des d\u00e9marches pour trouver un emploi convenable [32] L\u2019appelant a la responsabilit\u00e9 de chercher activement un emploi convenable afin de pouvoir obtenir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.Note de bas de page 9\n[33] La Commission soutient que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fait des d\u00e9marches de fa\u00e7on active pour se trouver un emploi puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de fournir des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[34] Il est vrai que le dossier de la Commission d\u00e9montre que le 22 ao\u00fbt 2023, l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00ab fait trop de d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi \u00bb \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il se trouvait dans une situation difficile. Cependant, je note que pendant ce m\u00eame entretien, il a expliqu\u00e9 avoir fait des d\u00e9marches pour modifier son permis de travail. Il indique alors \u00e9galement qu\u2019il souhaite travailler et trouver un employeur qui acceptera de l\u2019embaucher.\n[35] Les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi servent \u00e0 pallier une situation de ch\u00f4mage lorsqu\u2019un travailleur est \u00e0 la recherche d\u2019un emploi convenable et qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention d\u2019obtenir cet emploi convenable. L\u2019appelant doit d\u00e9montrer sa disponibilit\u00e9 en effectuant des d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi pendant tout jour ouvrable de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations.\n[36] Lors de l\u2019audience, le repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019appelant s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant superviseur chez X et il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait le mandat d\u2019\u00e9pauler l\u2019appelant afin qu\u2019il r\u00e9int\u00e8gre le march\u00e9 du travail. Ainsi, il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il a aid\u00e9 et qu\u2019il continue d\u2019aider l\u2019appelant \u00e0 trouver un autre emploi.\n[37] Comme d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019appelant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un document d\u00e9montrant les d\u00e9marches d\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a fait depuis le 9 septembre 2023 tandis que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites entre le 9 juillet 2023 et le 9 septembre 2023 sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans son avis d\u2019appel. Il est vrai que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas fourni le nom des personnes qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9es, mais son repr\u00e9sentant a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il l\u2019accompagnait et qu\u2019il expliquait la d\u00e9marche concernant le permis de travail aux employeurs.\n[38] J\u2019estime que l\u2019appelant a manifest\u00e9 son d\u00e9sir de retourner sur le march\u00e9 du travail par des efforts significatifs pour se trouver un emploi convenable chaque jour ouvrable de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations \u00e0 compter du 9 juillet 2023.\nLimiter ind\u00fbment ses chances de retourner travailler [39] L\u2019appelant soutient qu\u2019il a la volont\u00e9 de trouver un emploi et qu\u2019il est capable de travailler m\u00eame s\u2019il d\u00e9tient un permis de travail restreint. Il explique que malgr\u00e9 les restrictions de ce permis, il continue de faire des d\u00e9marches pour le modifier et il essaie de trouver un employeur qui accepterait de l\u2019embaucher.\n[40] Les faits d\u00e9montrent que l\u2019appelant d\u00e9tient un permis de travail lui permettant de travailler au Canada pour la p\u00e9riode du 30 novembre 2022 au 29 novembre 2024.Note de bas de page 10 Les conditions de ce permis pr\u00e9voient notamment que l\u2019appelant doit quitter le Canada au plus tard le 29 novembre 2024, qu\u2019il ne peut exercer un autre emploi que celui d\u2019op\u00e9rateur de machine \u00e0 imprimer et qu\u2019il ne peut travailler pour un autre employeur que X.\n[41] Les conditions de ce permis ne viennent limiter ind\u00fbment l\u2019appelant \u00e0 trouver un emploi convenable que s\u2019il ne fait aucune d\u00e9marche pour se trouver un emploi et s\u2019il n\u2019amorce aucune d\u00e9marche pour obtenir la permission de travailler pour un autre employeur. Dans les faits, dans le cas o\u00f9 un employeur met fin \u00e0 un tel contrat de travail d\u2019un travail, il peut remettre une lettre de d\u00e9charge au travailleur. L\u2019appelant a expliqu\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audience que l\u2019employeur lui a remis une lettre de d\u00e9charge. Ainsi, l\u2019appelant peut faire des d\u00e9marches pour faire autoriser un permis de travail par un autre employeur.\n[42] De plus, une d\u00e9cision de la division d\u2019appel du Tribunal indique qu'une restriction au permis de travail ne rend pas automatiquement un prestataire indisponible pour travailler \u00e0 condition que la restriction puisse \u00eatre lev\u00e9e ou que le permis puisse \u00eatre attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 un employeur diff\u00e9rent.Note de bas de page 11\n[43] J\u2019estime que c\u2019est le cas de l\u2019appelant. C\u2019est le fait de restreindre sa disponibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un seul employeur et non pas le permis de travail en tant que tel qui limite ind\u00fbment les chances d\u2019un prestataire de se trouver un emploi convenable.\n[44] Dans ce cas-ci, l\u2019appelant a cess\u00e9 d\u2019occuper son emploi le 7 juillet 2023 et j\u2019accepte ses explications indiquant qu\u2019il a fait des d\u00e9marches autant pour modifier son permis de travail que pour trouver un employeur qui accepterait de l\u2019embaucher.\n[45] J\u2019estime qu\u2019en faisant toutes les d\u00e9marches appropri\u00e9es, l\u2019appelant d\u00e9montre une volont\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le march\u00e9 du travail d\u00e8s que possible et que les conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 son permis de travail restreint ne le limitent que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il ne tente pas de les modifier.\n[46] Je donne un poids pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant aux d\u00e9clarations de l\u2019appelant faites lors de l\u2019audience. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les circonstances expos\u00e9es, je suis d\u2019avis que les chances de l\u2019appelant de se trouver un emploi convenable n\u2019\u00e9taient pas limit\u00e9es par une condition personnelle.\nAlors, l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait-il capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire ? [47] Je dois appliquer les crit\u00e8res permettant de d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler au sens de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et s\u2019il peut recevoir des prestations \u00e0 compter du 9 juillet 2023.\n[48] Dans le cas actuel, j\u2019ai \u00e9valu\u00e9 l\u2019attitude de l\u2019appelant. Son attitude d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il souhaite se trouver un emploi et qu\u2019il a fait tous les efforts qu\u2019il pouvait faire. Ces efforts sont significatifs, ils sont habituels et raisonnables.\n[49] Selon mes conclusions sur les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments, je conclus que l\u2019appelant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait capable de travailler et disponible pour le faire.\nConclusion [50] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est accueilli.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (le R\u00e8glement) et le paragraphe 50(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (la Loi).\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 9.001 du R\u00e8glement.\nNote de bas de page 3\nPi\u00e8ces GD3-19, GD2-16 et GD2-17.\nNote de bas de page 4\nPi\u00e8ce GD2-14.\nNote de bas de page 5\nPi\u00e8ce GD05.\nNote de bas de page 6\nCes trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont mentionn\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Faucher c Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration du Canada, A-56-96 et A-57-96.

L\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] La requ\u00e9rante, S. P., s\u2019est mari\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1976. Elle s\u2019est ensuite s\u00e9par\u00e9e en mars 2001 et a divorc\u00e9 en novembre 2003.\n[3] La requ\u00e9rante a demand\u00e9 un partage des cr\u00e9dits dans le cadre du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (aussi appel\u00e9 partage des gains non ajust\u00e9s ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension) en juillet 2019. Elle recevait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle dit avoir demand\u00e9 le partage des cr\u00e9dits uniquement parce qu\u2019une personne de Service Canada lui a dit qu\u2019elle recevrait plus d\u2019argent si elle le faisait.\n[4] Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a approuv\u00e9 la demande. Les cr\u00e9dits du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada de l\u2019ancien couple ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partis entre eux de 1976 \u00e0 2000.\n[5] En raison du partage des cr\u00e9dits, le montant de la pension de retraite de l\u2019appelante a diminu\u00e9, et non augment\u00e9. Elle a demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision et le ministre n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 d\u2019avis. Elle a fait appel au Tribunal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 son appel, concluant que le partage des cr\u00e9dits ne peut pas \u00eatre annul\u00e9.\nQuestions en litige [6] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La requ\u00e9rante a-t-elle soulev\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [7] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si la demande soul\u00e8ve un argument d\u00e9fendable selon lequel la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis l\u2019une des erreurs suivantes :\nElle n\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; Elle est all\u00e9e au-del\u00e0 de ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; Elle a commis une erreur de droit; Elle a commis une erreur de fait; Elle a commis une erreur au moment d\u2019appliquer la loi aux faitsNote de bas page 1.\n[8] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si la demande pr\u00e9sente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas page 2.\n[9] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 d\u2019argument d\u00e9fendable et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois refuser la permission de faire appel.\nAucune cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle une erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise [10] La requ\u00e9rante a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale parce qu\u2019elle dit avoir droit au montant de la pension de retraite qu\u2019elle recevait avant le partage des cr\u00e9dits. Elle ne comprend pas comment ni pourquoi le montant de sa pension a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit. Elle aimerait recommencer \u00e0 recevoir les paiements qu\u2019elle recevait avant le partage des cr\u00e9ditsNote de bas page 3.\n[11] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis une erreur. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa requ\u00e9rante a demand\u00e9 le partage de ses cr\u00e9dits de pension (elle a fait cela parce qu\u2019elle croyait que le montant mensuel de sa pension augmenterait)Note de bas page 4. Selon le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, il doit y avoir un partage des cr\u00e9dits si le ministre est inform\u00e9 d\u2019un divorce et re\u00e7oit certains renseignementsNote de bas page 5. La requ\u00e9rante est divorc\u00e9e et elle a fourni les renseignements au ministre (la demande de partage des cr\u00e9dits, la d\u00e9claration de mariage et le certificat de divorce)Note de bas page 6. Compte tenu de la situation de la requ\u00e9rante, le partage des cr\u00e9dits doit avoir lieuNote de bas page 7. Il y a seulement deux situations o\u00f9 le ministre peut refuser le partage des cr\u00e9dits, mais aucune ne s\u2019applique ici. Premi\u00e8rement, le ministre peut refuser le partage des cr\u00e9dits lorsque les paiements des deux personnes diminuent en raison du partage des cr\u00e9dits. Cependant, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, seuls les paiements de la requ\u00e9rante ont diminu\u00e9 (l\u2019ex-\u00e9poux de la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de pension de retraite). Deuxi\u00e8mement, le ministre peut refuser le partage des cr\u00e9dits lorsque, dans certaines situations, le couple conclut une entente \u00e9crite avant leur divorce pour ne pas partager les cr\u00e9dits de pension. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019avait pas ce genre d\u2019entente avant le divorceNote de bas page 8. Les dates de d\u00e9but et de fin du partage des cr\u00e9dits sont les bonnes. Les cr\u00e9dits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partis de janvier 1976 (l\u2019ann\u00e9e du mariage) \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2000 (la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la fin de la vie commune)Note de bas page 9.\n[12] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de cause d\u00e9fendable selon laquelle la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait commis une erreur. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 la loi relative au partage des cr\u00e9dits de pension \u00e0 la situation de la requ\u00e9rante. On ne peut pas soutenir ici que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal compris ce que la loi dit au sujet du moment o\u00f9 le partage des cr\u00e9dits doit avoir lieu. Dans cette affaire, il n\u2019y a aucun argument selon lequel la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait mal compris la situation de la requ\u00e9rante : celle-ci a fourni au ministre les renseignements qui signifiaient qu\u2019un partage des cr\u00e9dits devait avoir lieu. Elle ne se trouvait pas dans l\u2019une des deux situations o\u00f9 le ministre peut faire une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du partage des cr\u00e9dits.\n[13] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier. Je suis convaincue qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait ignor\u00e9 ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 et qui pourrait avoir une incidence sur le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019affaire de la requ\u00e9ranteNote de bas page 10.\nAucune nouvelle preuve [14] La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ainsi, de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne peuvent pas non plus servir de fondement \u00e0 un appel.\nConclusion [15] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.

Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 la demande parce qu\u2019elle ne vivait pas au Canada. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait besoin d\u2019au moins 20 ans de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour recevoir une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pendant qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Le ministre a soulign\u00e9 que la requ\u00e9rante comptait seulement 10 ann\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes de r\u00e9sidence, soit les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 elle r\u00e9sidait effectivement au Canada plus le temps ajout\u00e9 en application de l\u2019accord de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale conclu entre le Canada et l\u2019Estonie.\nLa requ\u00e9rante a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du ministre en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Celle-ci a accueilli l\u2019appel et accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse au taux de 11\/40e de la pleine pension. Le ministre a contest\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devant la division d\u2019appel.\nLa loi pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019une absence du Canada n\u2019interrompt pas la r\u00e9sidence au Canada si la personne r\u00e9sidait au pays et que son d\u00e9part a eu lieu dans certaines circonstances pr\u00e9vues par le R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Voici l\u2019une de ces circonstances :\n- une personne est engag\u00e9e hors du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e, de membre ou de fonctionnaire d\u2019une organisation internationale de bienfaisance et :\n- elle revient au Canada dans un d\u00e9lai de six mois apr\u00e8s la fin de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019engagement hors du Canada ou;\n- elle atteint, au cours de sa p\u00e9riode d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019engagement hors du Canada, l\u2019\u00e2ge la rendant admissible \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la requ\u00e9rante a cofond\u00e9 une organisation lettone \u00e0 but non lucratif appel\u00e9e X. Il semble qu\u2019elle si\u00e8ge au conseil de direction depuis la fondation de l\u2019organisation en septembre 2020. Elle affirme que X exerce ses activit\u00e9s en Lettonie, en Ouzb\u00e9kistan et en Serbie et recueille de l\u2019argent pour offrir de la nourriture, des v\u00eatements et des formations aux personnes dans le besoin.\nLa division d\u2019appel a conclu qu\u2019au sens du R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, les mots \u00ab engag\u00e9 \u00bb, \u00ab membre \u00bb et \u00ab organisation internationale de bienfaisance \u00bb sont sujets \u00e0 une interpr\u00e9tation large. La division d\u2019appel a confirm\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si elle admettait que la requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait et continue d\u2019\u00eatre engag\u00e9e comme membre d\u2019une organisation internationale de bienfaisance, la requ\u00e9rante ne pourrait pas gagner sa cause. En effet, cette derni\u00e8re ne remplissait pas toutes les conditions requises pour que son absence soit comptabilis\u00e9e comme une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au Canada. La division d\u2019appel ne pouvait pas conclure que la requ\u00e9rante \u00e9tait toujours une r\u00e9sidente canadienne, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre engag\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de X, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Quand la requ\u00e9rante a quitt\u00e9 le Canada en juin 2017, elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 67 ans. C\u2019\u00e9tait bien apr\u00e8s ses 65 ans, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00ab atteint \u00bb l\u2019\u00e2ge d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. La loi exige que les personnes qui demandent la pension et qui travaillent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger pour une organisation internationale de bienfaisance soient non seulement admissibles, mais qu\u2019elles deviennent aussi admissibles \u00e0 la pension pendant leur s\u00e9jour \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\nM\u00eame si la requ\u00e9rante travaillait pour une organisation internationale de bienfaisance, la division d\u2019appel a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9sidente du Canada en ao\u00fbt 2020, lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la requ\u00e9rante comptait un peu moins de 11 ans de r\u00e9sidence au Canada, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire moins que les 20 ans dont elle avait besoin pour toucher une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pendant qu\u2019elle vivait hors du Canada. La division d\u2019appel a accueilli l\u2019appel du ministre. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\n[TRADUCTION]\nCitation : Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social c LK, 2024 TSS 62\nTribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale du Canada Division d\u2019appel\nD\u00e9cision\nParties appelantes : Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social\nRepr\u00e9sentant : Yanick B\u00e9langer\nPartie intim\u00e9e : L.

L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\nAper\u00e7u [2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est n\u00e9e en Union sovi\u00e9tique en juin 1950. Elle a v\u00e9cu et travaill\u00e9 dans de nombreux pays, y compris la Lettonie, l\u2019Estonie, l\u2019Ouzb\u00e9kistan et la Serbie. Elle a immigr\u00e9 au Canada le 25 septembre 2007 et est rest\u00e9e ici jusqu\u2019au 6 juin 2016, date \u00e0 laquelle elle est retourn\u00e9e en Serbie. Elle y vit toujours.\n[3] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en ao\u00fbt 2020. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 la demande parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne vivait pas au Canada. Le ministre a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait besoin d\u2019au moins 20 ans de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour recevoir une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse alors qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Le ministre a fait remarquer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait seulement 10 ans de r\u00e9sidence, selon sa p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence r\u00e9elle au Canada et la dur\u00e9e ajout\u00e9e par l\u2019accord de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale du Canada avec l\u2019EstonieNote de bas de page 1.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a port\u00e9 le refus du ministre en appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal a tenu une audience par \u00e9crit et a accueilli l\u2019appel, accordant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse de 11\/40 du montant d\u2019une pleine pension.\n[5] Le ministre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il a demand\u00e9 la permission de faire appel \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel, soutenant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait commis une erreur de droit en accordant une pension \u00e0 une non-r\u00e9sidente qui avait v\u00e9cu au Canada pendant moins de 20 ans. En septembre dernier, une de mes coll\u00e8gues de la division d\u2019appel a accord\u00e9 au ministre la permission de faire appel. Plus t\u00f4t ce mois-ci, j\u2019ai tenu une audience pour discuter de l\u2019ensemble de sa cause.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des deux parties, j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 une pension partielle de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. La preuve montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne r\u00e9sidait pas au Canada lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 la pension et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas le minimum requis de 20 ans de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour la recevoir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\nQuestions pr\u00e9liminaires [7] Au cours des mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant son audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des douzaines de courriels et d\u2019autres documents, dont bon nombre se rapportaient \u00e0 sa demande de prestations du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es, qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Bien que j\u2019aie examin\u00e9 tous les documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je me suis concentr\u00e9 uniquement sur les renseignements qui \u00e9taient pertinents pour son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, en particulier ses p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9sidence au Canada et la question de savoir si elle pouvait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019accords de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale avec d\u2019autres pays.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal des courriels suppl\u00e9mentaires qui d\u00e9veloppaient des arguments qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s oralement et par \u00e9critNote de bas de page 2. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte de ces arguments parce que, d\u2019abord, ils ne contiennent rien de nouveau et, ensuite, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s non seulement apr\u00e8s la date limite de d\u00e9p\u00f4t, mais aussi apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience.\n[9] Les courriels r\u00e9p\u00e9taient \u00e9galement l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, initialement formul\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience, selon laquelle M. B\u00e9langer n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00fbment autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter le ministre. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, j\u2019ai proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience parce que je n\u2019ai rien vu qui laisse croire que M. B\u00e9langer, qui est selon moi un employ\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, ne pouvait pas parler au nom du ministre dans cette affaire. Ma d\u00e9cision sur cette question \u00e9tait d\u00e9finitive, et je ne vois aucune raison de la r\u00e9examiner.\nAnalyse [10] J\u2019ai appliqu\u00e9 la loi \u00e0 la preuve disponible. Je suis convaincu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle avait droit \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait presque neuf ans de r\u00e9sidence r\u00e9elle au Canada et plus de deux ans de p\u00e9riodes admissibles de l\u2019Estonie. Cependant, m\u00eame si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a travaill\u00e9 pour une organisation internationale de bienfaisance au cours des quatre ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant sa demande de pension, elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger lorsqu\u2019elle l\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Les p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9sidence ne repr\u00e9sentent pas les 20 ans requis pour recevoir une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pendant qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e avait presque neuf ans de r\u00e9sidence au Canada [11] Une personne r\u00e9side au Canada si elle \u00e9tablit sa demeure et vit ordinairement dans une r\u00e9gion du CanadaNote de bas de page 3.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est arriv\u00e9e au Canada \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sidente permanente le 25 septembre 2007 et s\u2019est \u00e9tablie \u00e0 Brampton, en Ontario. Elle a lou\u00e9 un appartement, ouvert un compte bancaire, s\u2019est fait des amis et a re\u00e7u des soins de sant\u00e9 et des prestations sociales. Elle est rest\u00e9e au Canada jusqu\u2019au 6 juin 2016, date \u00e0 laquelle elle a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 en Serbie. Elle ne semble pas avoir entretenu de liens importants avec le Canada depuis.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e et le ministre s\u2019entendent sur les dates mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus. Pour cette raison, je conviens que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a en fait v\u00e9cu au Canada pendant huit ans et 257 jours.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e avait plus de deux ans de p\u00e9riodes admissibles de l\u2019Estonie [14] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ses ann\u00e9es de r\u00e9sidence dans trois pays l\u2019aident \u00e0 remplir les conditions requises pour recevoir une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Je suis d\u2019accord avec elle, mais seulement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 un certain point.\n[15] Le Canada a conclu des accords de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale avec l\u2019Estonie, la Lettonie et la Serbie. Les accords pr\u00e9voient tous que les p\u00e9riodes admissibles aux termes des lois de ces pays peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9sidence au Canada dans le but d\u2019aider une partie prestataire \u00e0 remplir les conditions requises pour recevoir certaines prestations f\u00e9d\u00e9ralesNote de bas de page 4.\n[16] Le ministre a demand\u00e9 des renseignements aux trois pays, mais seule l\u2019Estonie a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait des p\u00e9riodes admissibles aux termes de son accord avec le Canada. Selon le gouvernement de l\u2019Estonie, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait des p\u00e9riodes admissibles qui ajoutaient deux ans et 103 jours \u00e0 sa p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au CanadaNote de bas de page 5.\n[17] Les r\u00e9ponses aux demandes semblables faites \u00e0 la Lettonie ou \u00e0 la Serbie n\u2019ont pas aid\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Aucun des deux pays n\u2019a reconnu de p\u00e9riodes admissibles aux termes de leurs accords avec le CanadaNote de bas de page 6.\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019elle avait des p\u00e9riodes admissibles de la Lettonie et de la Serbie et que le gouvernement du Canada aurait d\u00fb faire quelque chose pour forcer ces pays \u00e0 les divulguer. Toutefois, je peux m\u2019appuyer uniquement sur la preuve dont je dispose. M\u00eame si aucun des deux pays n\u2019a dit ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulait entendre, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de croire qu\u2019ils dissimulent des renseignements.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e a peut-\u00eatre travaill\u00e9 pour un organisme de bienfaisance international, mais elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9sidente du Canada lorsqu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse [19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ellement v\u00e9cu au Canada depuis le 6 juin 2016. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle est tout de m\u00eame une r\u00e9sidente du Canada depuis cette date parce qu\u2019elle travaille pour une organisation internationale de bienfaisance depuis huit ans.\n[20] La loi pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019absence d\u2019une personne n\u2019interrompt pas sa r\u00e9sidence au Canada si elle y r\u00e9sidait et est partie dans certaines circonstances pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans le R\u00e8glement sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesseNote de bas de page 7. Voici l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles :\nlorsqu\u2019une personne est engag\u00e9e hors du Canada \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e, de membre ou de fonctionnaire d\u2019une organisation internationale de bienfaisance, si elle remplit une des conditions suivantes :\nElle est revenue au Canada dans les six mois suivant la fin de son emploi ou de son engagement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Elle a atteint un \u00e2ge la rendant admissible \u00e0 une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e ou engag\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger [c\u2019est moi qui souligne]Note de bas de page 8.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a cofond\u00e9 une organisation lettone \u00e0 but non lucratif nomm\u00e9e X en septembre 2000 et semble avoir si\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 son comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif depuisNote de bas de page 9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que X exerce ses activit\u00e9s en Lettonie, en Ouzb\u00e9kistan et en Serbie. L\u2019organisation recueille des fonds pour fournir de la nourriture et des v\u00eatements et enseigner des comp\u00e9tences aux gens dans le besoin.\n[22] Les mots \u00ab engag\u00e9e \u00bb, \u00ab membre \u00bb et \u00ab organisation internationale de bienfaisance \u00bb peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation large. Je ne sais pas si X est toujours active ni dans quelle mesure l\u2019intim\u00e9e est \u00ab engag\u00e9e \u00bb dans ses activit\u00e9s. Cependant, m\u00eame si je conviens que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 et continue d\u2019\u00eatre engag\u00e9e comme membre d\u2019une organisation internationale de bienfaisance, elle ne peut toujours pas gagner sa cause.\n[23] En effet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne remplissait pas toutes les conditions requises pour que son absence soit compt\u00e9e comme une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au Canada. L\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9sidait au Canada imm\u00e9diatement avant de partir pour la Serbie, et elle n\u2019est pas revenue au Canada depuis. Cependant, je ne peux pas conclure qu\u2019elle demeure r\u00e9sidente du Canada, m\u00eame si elle a travaill\u00e9 avec X, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas atteint un \u00e2ge la rendant admissible \u00e0 une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. L\u2019intim\u00e9e avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 67 ans lorsqu\u2019elle a quitt\u00e9 le Canada en juin 2017. Elle avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 65 ans, l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel elle a initialement \u00ab atteint \u00bb le seuil d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\n[24] Il est vrai que si elle \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e au Canada, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible \u00e0 demander la pension \u00e0 tout moment apr\u00e8s son 65e anniversaire. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas rest\u00e9e au Canada. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, \u00ab \u00eatre \u00bb admissible \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en vivant au Canada est diff\u00e9rent d\u2019\u00ab atteindre \u00bb le seuil d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en vivant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. La loi, telle qu\u2019elle est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e, exige clairement qu\u2019une partie prestataire qui travaille pour une organisation internationale de bienfaisance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger non seulement soit admissible, mais devienne admissible \u00e0 la pension pendant qu\u2019elle est \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas les 20 ans requis de r\u00e9sidence au Canada pour recevoir la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse pendant qu\u2019elle vivait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger [25] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9ellement r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pendant huit ans et 257 jours et, aux termes de l\u2019accord sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale conclu avec la Lettonie, elle a une p\u00e9riode admissible de deux ans et 103 jours. Cela totalise 10 ans et 360 jours.\n[26] Comme mentionn\u00e9, les quatre ann\u00e9es que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pass\u00e9es \u00e0 travailler pour X entre son d\u00e9part du Canada en juin 2016 et sa demande de prestations de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse en ao\u00fbt 2020 ne peuvent pas \u00eatre compt\u00e9es comme une p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9sidence au Canada. En effet, elle n\u2019est ni revenue au Canada dans les six mois suivant son d\u00e9sengagement de X ni n\u2019a \u00ab atteint \u00bb l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans alors qu\u2019elle travaillait pour X \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger.\n[27] Selon la loi, les personnes qui demandent une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse et r\u00e9sident \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger au moment de pr\u00e9senter leur demande doivent prouver qu\u2019elles ont r\u00e9sid\u00e9 au Canada pendant au moins 20 ansNote de bas de page 10.

L\u2019appelante, B. L., n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 d\u2019autres paiements r\u00e9troactifs de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision explique pourquoi je rejette l\u2019appel.\nAper\u00e7u [3] L\u2019appelante est n\u00e9e en avril 1963. Elle a eu 60 ans en avril 2023.\n[4] En juin 2023, le ministre a re\u00e7u sa demande de pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du CanadaNote de bas de page 1. Cette pension est fond\u00e9e sur les cotisations vers\u00e9es au R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Elle est payable sous certaines conditions aux personnes de 60 ans et plus qui ont cotis\u00e9 au R\u00e9gimeNote de bas de page 2.\n[5] Le ministre a trait\u00e9 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante en juin 2023. Les paiements devaient commencer en juillet 2023Note de bas de page 3.\n[6] L\u2019appelante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de la date du d\u00e9but des versements. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en mai 2022, elle avait rempli une demande en ligne pour obtenir la pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime. Dans cette demande, elle avait \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle voulait que sa pension commence en mai 2023. Elle a demand\u00e9 que mai 2023 soit le mois du d\u00e9but de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime.\n[7] En septembre 2023, le ministre a rejet\u00e9 la demande de r\u00e9vision de l\u2019appelanteNote de bas de page 4. Il a affirm\u00e9 que rien au dossier ne montrait qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 la pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime en mai 2022. Le bureau du ministre a re\u00e7u sa demande en juin 2023. Ainsi, l\u2019appelante n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 la pension avant juillet 2023.\n[8] L\u2019appelante a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\nCe que je dois d\u00e9cider [9] Je dois d\u00e9cider si l\u2019appelante a droit \u00e0 une plus longue p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 pour le versement de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[10] Voici les questions dont je dois tenir compte :\ni) Le ministre peut\u2011il accorder un plus grand nombre de paiements r\u00e9troactifs en fonction de la demande de 2022?\nii) Le ministre peut\u2011il accorder un plus grand nombre de paiements r\u00e9troactifs en fonction de la demande de juin 2023?\niii) Peut\u2011on consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande plus t\u00f4t en raison d\u2019une erreur administrative du ministre?\nLa position de l\u2019appelante [11] Durant son t\u00e9moignage, l\u2019appelante a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019en mai 2022, son mari et elle ont rempli la demande de pension de retraite en ligne.\n[12] Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en juin 2023, elle a discut\u00e9 de sa pension de retraite avec une personne de Service Canada. Cette derni\u00e8re a dit qu\u2019elle voyait la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante en 2022. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise correctement, mais le ministre n\u2019avait rien fait dans son dossier. Lorsque l\u2019appelante a demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision, sa demande a quand m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Elle pensait que, compte tenu de sa demande de 2022, sa pension de retraite aurait d\u00fb commencer en mai 2023.\nLes motifs de ma d\u00e9cision i. La demande de 2022 [13] La demande faite par l\u2019appelante en 2022 pr\u00e9sente deux probl\u00e8mes. Premi\u00e8rement, la loi pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019une prestation est payable seulement si une demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et que le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9Note de bas de page 5. Le versement de la pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 pour la demande de mai 2022.\n[14] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la demande de mai 2022 n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 aucune d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision au titre de l\u2019article 81 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Aux termes de l\u2019article 82 du R\u00e9gime, le seul fondement d\u2019un appel au Tribunal est la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision.\n[15] Durant la r\u00e9vision, le ministre avait le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider une seule chose : si sa d\u00e9cision initiale au sujet de la demande de juin 2023 \u00e9tait correcte. Il n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019examiner une autre demande possiblement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019appelante. Par cons\u00e9quent, le ministre ne pouvait pas modifier le mois du d\u00e9but de la pension de l\u2019appelante en fonction de la demande de 2022Note de bas de page 6.\nii. La demande de 2023 [16] Pour une personne de moins de 65 ans pour qui le paiement de la pension de retraite est approuv\u00e9, la loi pr\u00e9voit que le paiement commence au dernier en date des mois suivants :\nle mois au cours duquel la personne atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans; le mois suivant la r\u00e9ception de la demande par le ministre, si la personne avait moins de 65 ans au moment de la r\u00e9ception de la demande; le mois que la personne a choisi dans sa demandeNote de bas de page 7.\n[17] Voici les dates pertinentes pour l\u2019appelante :\nElle a eu 60 ans au cours du mois d\u2019avril 2023. Le mois suivant la r\u00e9ception de la demande est juillet 2023. La date que l\u2019appelante a choisie dans sa demande \u00e9tait inconnue. Elle ne figure pas au dossier. Il est raisonnable de supposer qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 que la pension de retraite commence en mai 2023.\n[18] Le dernier des trois mois est juillet 2023. Le ministre a re\u00e7u la demande de l\u2019appelante en juin 2023 et le versement a commenc\u00e9 en juillet 2023.\n[19] L\u2019appelante a eu la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 maximale pr\u00e9vue par le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada pour le paiement de sa pension.\n[20] La loi n\u2019autorise aucun paiement r\u00e9troactif pour les personnes de moins de 65 ansNote de bas de page 8.\niii. Peut\u2011on consid\u00e9rer que l\u2019appelante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande plus t\u00f4t en raison d\u2019une erreur administrative du ministre? [21] L\u2019appelante insiste pour dire qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9 sa demande en ligne au ministre en mai 2022. Si c\u2019est vrai, son all\u00e9gation pourrait permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le ministre a fait une \u00ab erreur administrative \u00bb ou qu\u2019il a donn\u00e9 un \u00ab avis erron\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[22] Le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada explique ce qui peut arriver en cas d\u2019erreur administrative ou d\u2019avis erron\u00e9. Si le ministre est convaincu que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre s\u2019est produit et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, une partie de la prestation a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e, il \u00ab prend les mesures correctives qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9es \u00bb pour placer la personne dans la situation o\u00f9 elle devrait se trouverNote de bas de page 9.\n[23] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019intervenir en cas d\u2019erreur administrative ou d\u2019avis erron\u00e9Note de bas de page 10.\n[24] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les parties ont discut\u00e9 de la question de savoir si, en mai 2022, l\u2019appelante avait re\u00e7u dans son compte Mon dossier Service Canada une notification instantan\u00e9e l\u2019avisant de la r\u00e9ception de sa demande de pension de retraite du R\u00e9gimeNote de bas de page 11. Selon le site Web du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada, c\u2019est ce qui est cens\u00e9 se produire. L\u2019appelante ne se souvenait pas si elle l\u2019avait eue.\n[25] La repr\u00e9sentante du ministre a inform\u00e9 l\u2019appelante que si elle avait re\u00e7u un tel accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception, elle pouvait le r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer. Elle lui recommande de l\u2019imprimer et de l\u2019apporter au bureau de Service Canada le plus pr\u00e8s de chez elle. Elle peut demander au personnel de le faire parvenir au Centre Service Canada de Scarborough et devrait prendre des notes sur sa conversation avec le personnel. En cas d\u2019erreur administrative ou d\u2019avis erron\u00e9, elle pourrait avoir droit au versement de sa pension de retraite \u00e0 compter de mai 2023.\n[26] Je suis sensible \u00e0 la situation de l\u2019appelante. Elle voulait que le versement de sa pension de retraite commence en mai 2023. Elle pense avoir fait tout son possible pour atteindre son objectif. Malgr\u00e9 cela, ses versements ont commenc\u00e9 seulement deux mois plus tard. Elle a dit avoir perdu plus de 400 $ en pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime \u00e0 cause de [traduction] \u00ab mauvaises recherches dans les dossiers informatiquesNote de bas de page 12 \u00bb.\n[27] Je ne peux pas aider l\u2019appelante. Mon pouvoir d\u00e9cisionnel d\u00e9coule de la loi. Je suis oblig\u00e9e de respecter les dispositions du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Je dois interpr\u00e9ter et appliquer la loi telle qu\u2019elle est \u00e9crite dans le R\u00e9gime. Je n\u2019ai pas le pouvoir de faire des exceptions. Je ne peux pas non plus rendre des d\u00e9cisions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, la compassion ou des circonstances att\u00e9nuantes.\nConclusion [28] Je conclus que la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas droit \u00e0 une plus grande p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 pour le versement de sa pension de retraite du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir la page GD02-11 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 2\nSelon l\u2019article 44(1)(a) du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la page GD02-10.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la page GD02-6.\nNote de bas de page 5\nSelon l\u2019article 60(1) du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.

L\u2019appelante (Commission) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cette somme \u00e9tait une \u00ab r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00bb vers\u00e9e sous forme d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de paie de vacances.

Le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la somme de 10 959&nbap;$ que le prestataire a re\u00e7u est une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration mais que celle-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement r\u00e9partie par la Commission.

[12] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la somme de 10 959&nbap;$ que le prestataire a re\u00e7u est une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration mais que celle-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement r\u00e9partie par la Commission. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la somme doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partie sur sept semaines, \u00e0 partir de la semaine du 27 novembre 2022, selon une somme de 1 692&nbap;$ par semaine. Ce qu\u2019il reste de la somme de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration doit \u00eatre r\u00e9parti sur la derni\u00e8re semaine.\n[13] La Commission avance que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale commis une erreur dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 36(9) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019AE lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la r\u00e9partition de la somme re\u00e7ue en fin d\u2019emploi devait d\u00e9buter le 27 novembre, plut\u00f4t que le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2022.\n[14] Je prends en consid\u00e9ration qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration hebdomadaire normale du prestataire \u00e9tait de 1 692 $ et que le dernier jour travaill\u00e9 est le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2022.\n[15] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la somme hebdomadaire de 1 692 $ devait \u00eatre r\u00e9partie \u00e0 compter de la semaine du 27 novembre 2022, celle de la cessation d\u2019emploi.\n[16] Il est vrai que l\u2019article 36(9) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi pr\u00e9voit que toute r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pay\u00e9e \u00e0 une partie prestataire en raison de la cessation de son emploi est r\u00e9partie \u00e0 compter de la semaine de la cessation d\u2019emploi. Toutefois, l\u2019article \u00e9tablit \u00e9galement que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale que la partie prestataire a tir\u00e9e de son emploi est, dans chaque semaine cons\u00e9cutive, sauf la derni\u00e8re, \u00e9gale \u00e0 sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration hebdomadaire normale provenant de cet emploi.\n[17] Autrement dit, si une partie prestataire touche son plein salaire pour la semaine de la cessation d\u2019emploi, la somme re\u00e7ue doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partie sur la semaine suivante. Ainsi, \u00ab la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration totale [...] de cet emploi dans chaque semaine cons\u00e9cutive, sauf la derni\u00e8re, [est] \u00e9gale \u00e0 sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration hebdomadaire normale provenant de cet emploi \u00bb. Note de bas de page 2\n[18] Cependant, si une partie prestataire ne fait pas une semaine de travail compl\u00e8te, la somme sera r\u00e9partie sur la semaine de la cessation d\u2019emploi.\n[19] Je suis donc d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 36(9) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019AE. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 tort que la r\u00e9partition de la somme re\u00e7ue en fin d\u2019emploi devait d\u00e9buter la semaine du 27 novembre, plut\u00f4t que celle du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2022, puisque le prestataire a touch\u00e9 son plein salaire la semaine de la cessation de son emploi.\n[20] Je suis donc en droit d\u2019intervenir sur cette question.\nRem\u00e8de [21] Je suis d\u2019avis que les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9fendre leur cause devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Je vais donc rendre la d\u00e9cision que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb rendre.\n[22] La preuve d\u00e9montre que la demande de prestations du prestataire, qui devait initialement se terminer le 14 janvier 2023, a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e de six (6) semaines jusqu\u2019au 25 f\u00e9vrier 2023. Cependant, la r\u00e9partition de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration doit commencer la semaine du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2022, parce que le prestataire a touch\u00e9 son plein salaire pour la semaine du 27 novembre 2022.\n[23] La somme de 10 959 $ doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partie \u00e0 compter de la semaine du 4 d\u00e9cembre 2022, \u00e0 raison de 1 692 $ par semaine, et 807 $ doit \u00eatre r\u00e9partis \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re semaine, soit celle du 15 janvier 2023. Le prestataire doit rembourser 638 $.Note de bas de page 3\n[24] Le prestataire fait valoir qu\u2019il est en droit de rembourser que le montant net re\u00e7u, et non le montant brut.\n[25] Les prestations d'assurance-emploi, tout comme le salaire, sont payables brutes, moins les retenues fiscales obligatoires. Le prestataire peut communiquer avec l\u2019agence fiscale appropri\u00e9e au sujet du remboursement possible des d\u00e9ductions effectu\u00e9es sur les prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi \u00e0 rembourser, afin de recouvrir la diff\u00e9rence entre la valeur brute et la valeur nette du versement exc\u00e9dentaire.\nConclusion [26] L\u2019appel de la Commission est accueilli\n[27] Le prestataire doit rembourser un total de 638 $.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Jean, 2015 CAF 242; Maunder c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 274.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada c WC, 2022 TSS 595.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir tableau GD3-26.\n",

Le 13 mars 2020, il a perdu son emploi en raison de la pand\u00e9mie de la COVID-19. Le prestataire a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de prestations. Il a re\u00e7u une avance de 2 000 $ de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Commission). Il a cess\u00e9 de remplir ses d\u00e9clarations apr\u00e8s deux semaines puisqu\u2019il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 avoir combl\u00e9 ses pertes de revenus qui \u00e9taient d\u2019environ 3 000 $, ce qui correspondait aux prestations re\u00e7ues.\n[3] Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 des v\u00e9rifications, la Commission lui r\u00e9clame l\u2019avance de 2 000 $. Le prestataire a demand\u00e9 une r\u00e9vision mais la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale.

Ils conviennent que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en omettant de consid\u00e9rer les articles 153.7(1) (1.1), et 153.8(1) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi qui indiquent ce qui suit :\n153.7 (1) La prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence est \u00e0 verser au prestataire qui pr\u00e9sente une demande en vertu de l\u2019article 153.8 et qui y est admissible.\n(1.1) La Commission peut verser la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence au prestataire avant le moment normalement pr\u00e9vu pour le faire.\n153.8 (1) Tout prestataire peut, selon les modalit\u00e9s \u2014 notamment de forme \u2014 fix\u00e9es par le ministre, pr\u00e9senter une demande de prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi d\u2019urgence pour toute p\u00e9riode, commen\u00e7ant un dimanche, de deux semaines comprises dans la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 15 mars 2020 et se terminant le 3 octobre 2020.\n[9] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les parties.

A, le requ\u00e9rant, s\u2019est vu accorder une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse devant d\u00e9buter en juin 2020.\n[3] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a jamais demand\u00e9 cette pension. Elle lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e automatiquement par le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\n[4] Le 16 juin 2022, soit pr\u00e8s de deux ans plus tard, le requ\u00e9rant a demand\u00e9 au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. Le 5 janvier 2023, le ministre a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision puisque le d\u00e9lai \u00e0 cet effet \u00e9tait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 et que le requ\u00e9rant \u00e9tait en retard. Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une personne peut demander l\u2019annulation d\u2019une pension [traduction] \u00ab au plus tard six mois apr\u00e8s la date o\u00f9 commence le versement de la pensionNote de bas de page 1. \u00bb\n[5] Pour que le ministre lui accorde plus de temps pour demander une r\u00e9vision, le requ\u00e9rant devait remplir quatre crit\u00e8res et lui montrer ce qui suitNote de bas de page 2 :\nil a une explication raisonnable pour son retard; il a toujours voulu demander au ministre de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision (c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle une \u00ab intention constante \u00bb); sa demande de r\u00e9vision a une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s; un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019est pas in\u00e9quitable envers l\u2019autre partie.\n[6] Le requ\u00e9rant a fait appel au Tribunal. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que la demande de r\u00e9vision du requ\u00e9rant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en retard au ministre. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a donc cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si le ministre avait exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire quand il a refus\u00e9 de donner un d\u00e9lai additionnel au requ\u00e9rant pour demander une r\u00e9vision. Comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on judiciaire si le ministre avait :\nagi de mauvaise foi; agi dans un but ou pour un motif irr\u00e9gulier; consid\u00e9r\u00e9 un facteur non pertinent; ignor\u00e9 un facteur pertinentNote de bas de page 3.\n[7] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le ministre avait agi judiciairement en refusant au requ\u00e9rant un d\u00e9lai additionnel pour demander une r\u00e9vision.\nQuestions en litige [8] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) Le requ\u00e9rant a-t-il invoqu\u00e9 une erreur commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s? b) La demande pr\u00e9sente-t-elle des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel [9] Je peux accorder au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas suivi une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 4.\n[10] Je peux \u00e9galement donner au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel s\u2019il pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 5.\n[11] Comme le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une cause d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nLe requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 une erreur commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui donnerait \u00e0 son appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s [12] Le requ\u00e9rant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie d\u2019arguments concernant des erreurs qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Voici ce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend :\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019octroi automatique de pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse \u00e0 des personnes qui sont dans sa situation, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire aux personnes qui travaillent et peuvent ainsi perdre la totalit\u00e9 de la pension ou perdre une partie de leurs paiements plus tard; La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la raison pour laquelle il avait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande de r\u00e9vision. En effet, la COVID-19 avait accru la pression au travail tout en rendant plus difficile l\u2019acc\u00e8s en personne \u00e0 un centre Service Canada. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte du temps qu\u2019il avait fallu au ministre pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 sa demande de r\u00e9vision, ce qui permet de douter de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de lui imposer, \u00e0 lui, des d\u00e9lais strictsNote de bas de page 6.\n[13] Aucun de ces arguments ne donne \u00e0 son appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Je ne peux donc pas lui accorder la permission de faire appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019une erreur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise parce que les probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019octroi automatique d\u2019une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s [14] Le requ\u00e9rant a soulev\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de probl\u00e8mes avec l\u2019octroi automatique d\u2019une pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse. Il reconna\u00eet que cette approche est favorable \u00e0 certains, particuli\u00e8rement aux personnes \u00e0 faible revenu, et permet au ministre d\u2019all\u00e9ger son fardeau administratif. Cependant, l\u2019octroi automatique de la pension \u00e9tait probl\u00e9matique dans son cas. Le ministre savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que la totalit\u00e9 de la pension serait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9e compte tenu de son revenu. Selon lui, le fait d\u2019accorder automatiquement la pension ne fait que r\u00e9duire ses prestations globales et l\u2019oblige \u00e0 demander lui-m\u00eame de ne pas recevoir la pension pour corriger le probl\u00e8me. Le requ\u00e9rant affirme que le ministre a agi de mauvaise foi en lui donnant automatiquement la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse, compte tenu de sa situation.\n[15] On ne peut pas soutenir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait ignor\u00e9 cette question. En fait, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 plut\u00f4t en d\u00e9tail cet argument du requ\u00e9rant sur l\u2019octroi automatique de la pensionNote de bas de page 7. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le ministre n\u2019avait pas besoin de tenir compte de l\u2019effet de cette automatisation, pour les raisons suivantes :\nLe ministre avait envoy\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant des lettres l\u2019informant de l\u2019octroi automatique de la pension, avec des coordonn\u00e9es et des ressources pour obtenir plus de d\u00e9tails. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a jamais communiqu\u00e9 avec le ministre pour obtenir des pr\u00e9cisions. Le requ\u00e9rant avait dispos\u00e9 de six mois, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du versement, pour demander l\u2019annulation de la pension de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la vieillesse.\n[16] Compte tenu de ces faits, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que les probl\u00e8mes du requ\u00e9rant avec l\u2019octroi automatique de la pension n\u2019\u00e9taient pas un facteur pertinent que le ministre aurait ignor\u00e9.\n[17] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 d\u2019argument d\u00e9fendable voulant qu\u2019une erreur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 son argument quant au r\u00f4le qu\u2019aurait pu avoir l\u2019octroi automatique de la pension dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre. Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s en soutenant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait ignor\u00e9 cette question ou qu\u2019elle avait mal compris les faits relatifs \u00e0 cette automatisation dans sa situation pr\u00e9cise.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019une erreur ait \u00e9t\u00e9 commise parce que le motif expliquant la demande de r\u00e9vision tardive n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris en compte [18] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas tenu compte de sa preuve concernant la raison pour laquelle il avait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa demande de r\u00e9vision. Le requ\u00e9rant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9 au travail durant la pand\u00e9mie et que les centres Service Canada avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9s pendant un certain temps. \u00c0 cause de la pand\u00e9mie, il est seulement all\u00e9 dans un centre Service Canada en 2022.\n[19] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que le requ\u00e9rant avait expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas rectifi\u00e9 le versement automatique de la pension d\u00e8s qu\u2019il s\u2019en \u00e9tait rendu compte du fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9 au travail et ne voulait pas aller dans un centre Service Canada durant la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19Note de bas de page 8. Toutefois, le r\u00f4le de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale se limitait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le ministre avait agi de fa\u00e7on judiciaire en examinant le motif du retard du requ\u00e9rant, et c\u2019est ce qu\u2019elle a fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 ou mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ces renseignements.\n[20] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur donnant \u00e0 son appel une chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable qu\u2019il y ait eu une erreur parce que le temps que le ministre a pris pour r\u00e9pondre au requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 [21] Le requ\u00e9rant soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait en ignorant la preuve concernant le temps qu\u2019il a fallu au ministre pour donner suite \u00e0 sa demande de r\u00e9vision apr\u00e8s lui avoir accord\u00e9 automatiquement la pension.\n[22] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 d'un d\u00e9lai imputable au ministre. N\u00e9anmoins, ce fait n\u2019aide pas \u00e0 montrer qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur.\n[23] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, m\u00eame si elle ne traite pas de chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans sa d\u00e9cision. Le requ\u00e9rant peut infirmer cette pr\u00e9somption s\u2019il d\u00e9montre que l\u2019importance d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve particulier est telle qu\u2019il fallait que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale en discuteNote de bas de page 9.\n[24] \u00c0 mes yeux, le temps que le ministre a pris pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de r\u00e9vision du requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la question que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait trancher, et la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne pouvait donc pas commettre une erreur de fait en l\u2019ignorant. La seule question que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait trancher \u00e9tait de savoir si le ministre avait agi de fa\u00e7on judiciaire en soupesant les facteurs permettant de prolonger le d\u00e9lai. Le temps que le ministre a pris pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de r\u00e9vision n\u2019est pas un facteur que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait prendre en consid\u00e9ration. Il ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas non plus au regard des facteurs que le ministre devait consid\u00e9rer pour accorder un plus long d\u00e9lai au requ\u00e9rant.\nAucune nouvelle preuve [25] Le requ\u00e9rant n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui n\u2019aurait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Par cons\u00e9quent, la permission de faire appel ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e sur la base d\u2019une nouvelle preuve.\nConclusion [26] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 au requ\u00e9rant la permission de faire appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel n\u2019ira pas de l\u2019avant.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nLa lettre relative \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision, dat\u00e9e du 5 janvier 2023, se trouve \u00e0 la page GD2-8-9 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir les articles 74.1(3) et (4) du R\u00e8glement sur le R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir le paragraphe 18 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir les articles 58.1(a) et (b) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir l\u2019article 58.1(c) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 6\nVoir AD1 au dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 7\nVoir les paragraphes 21 \u00e0 24 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNote de bas de page 8\nVoir le paragraphe 11 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNote de bas de page 9\nVoir la d\u00e9cision Lee Villeneuve c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2013 CF 498.\n",

La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la question dont elle \u00e9tait saisie \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019appelant, N. B. (prestataire), avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son appel en retard \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[3] Le prestataire tentait de faire appel d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision rendue par la Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada le 27 avril 2023. Il a joint une copie de cette d\u00e9cision \u00e0 son avis d\u2019appelNote de bas de page 1. Cependant, il a aussi ajout\u00e9 une autre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision, dat\u00e9e du 7 janvier 2021 [sic].\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire faisait appel de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision de janvier 2021. Elle a donc jug\u00e9 que le prestataire avait plus d\u2019un an de retard lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son appel le 24 mai 2023. Par cons\u00e9quent, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que \u00ab la demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi de l\u2019appelant [ne pouvait pas] \u00eatre antidat\u00e9eNote de bas de page 2 \u00bb parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 temps.\n[5] Le prestataire soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence et de fait en tranchant la mauvaise question.\n[6] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a soulev\u00e9 la mauvaise question, en partie parce qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u de la Commission une copie incompl\u00e8te du dossier. Par cons\u00e9quent, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence, de droit et de fait.\n[7] Normalement, la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e consisterait \u00e0 renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour r\u00e9examen. Cependant, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire le 10 octobre 2023, dans le cadre d\u2019un double appel que le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9.\n[8] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne peut pas instruire de nouveau la m\u00eame affaire parce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu une d\u00e9cision. Pour cette raison, je rejette l\u2019appel.\nQuestions pr\u00e9liminaires [9] J\u2019ai r\u00e9cemment tenu une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire. J\u2019ai confirm\u00e9 avec le prestataire qu\u2019il ne souhaite plus avoir d\u2019audience en personne et qu\u2019il est d\u2019accord pour que l\u2019appel se d\u00e9roule par \u00e9crit.\nContexte factuel D\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 7 janvier 2021 [sic] [10] La Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision le 7 janvier 2021. Le prestataire a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. La Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision le 21 janvier 2021Note de bas de page 3. La d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 21 janvier 2021 portait sur la question de l\u2019antidatation d\u2019une demande.\nD\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 27 avril 2023 [11] La Commission a rendu une autre d\u00e9cision initiale le 21 novembre 2022Note de bas de page 4. Le prestataire a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser sa d\u00e9cision. La Commission a rendu une d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision le 27 avril 2023Note de bas de page 5. La d\u00e9cision initiale et la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision portaient sur les questions de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du prestataire et de la r\u00e9partition de cette r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[12] La Commission a conclu que le prestataire avait fait une d\u00e9claration trompeuse au sujet de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration (bien qu\u2019il ait par la suite volontairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, de sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti \u00e0 une sanction). La d\u00e9cision du 27 avril 2023 indique aussi que la Commission annulait sa d\u00e9cision sur la question de la r\u00e9partition de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9rationNote de bas de page 6.\n[13] Le prestataire a fait appel de cette d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 deux reprises, dans le cadre de deux appels distincts \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\ni. GE\u201123\u20111437 : premier appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le 24 mai 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 10 octobre 2023. Le 23 octobre 2023, le prestataire a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel, sous le num\u00e9ro de dossier AD\u201123\u2011982. ii. GE\u201123\u20111439 : deuxi\u00e8me appel d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e9galement le 24 mai 2023. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision le 24 juillet 2023. Le 31 juillet 2023, le prestataire a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel, sous le num\u00e9ro de dossier AD\u201123\u2011739. Voil\u00e0 l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisie.\n[14] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un double appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le prestataire veut ou voulait faire appel de la m\u00eame d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision.\nQuestions en litige [15] Voici les questions que je dois trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a-t-elle commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence, de droit ou de fait? b) Si c\u2019est le cas, comment faut-il les corriger?\nAnalyse [16] La division d\u2019appel peut intervenir dans les d\u00e9cisions de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale si celle-ci a commis une erreur de comp\u00e9tence, de proc\u00e9dure, de droit ou certains types d\u2019erreurs de faitNote de bas de page 7.\n[17] Pour ces types d\u2019erreurs de fait, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait avoir fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur cette erreur et avoir commis l\u2019erreur de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire, ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissanceNote de bas de page 8.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la mauvaise d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision [18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la mauvaise d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision. Il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9vident pour la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le prestataire faisait appel de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 27 avril 2023 et non de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 7 janvier 2021 [sic].\n[19] Le prestataire a joint les deux d\u00e9cisions de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 son avis d\u2019appel. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 d\u2019autres documents qui portaient sur la r\u00e9partition de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et sur une demande tardive.\n[20] La Commission a fourni une copie du dossier, qui contenait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 21 janvier 2021. Le document GD3 comprenait les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants : la demande du prestataire dat\u00e9e du 6 janvier 2021; un relev\u00e9 d\u2019emploi dat\u00e9 du 9 juillet 2021; une demande d\u2019antidatation dat\u00e9e du 7 janvier 2021; la demande de r\u00e9vision du prestataire sur la question d\u2019antidatation; et la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 21 janvier 2021, qui portait sur la question d\u2019antidatation.\n[21] Il n\u2019est pas surprenant que le dossier de la Commission ait fait croire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que l\u2019appel du prestataire \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision portant sur la question d\u2019antidatation, rendue par la Commission le 21 janvier 2021.\n[22] Toutefois, le prestataire a indiqu\u00e9 dans son avis d\u2019appel quelle d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision il portait en appel. Dans le formulaire d\u2019appel, le prestataire devait pr\u00e9ciser la date \u00e0 laquelle il avait re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dont il faisait appel. Il a clairement indiqu\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision le 27 avril 2023. Par cons\u00e9quent, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb comprendre que le prestataire faisait appel de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision du 27 avril 2023.\n[23] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la preuve (l\u2019avis d\u2019appel). Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a tranch\u00e9 la mauvaise question.\n[24] \u00c0 tout le moins, comme le prestataire avait joint les d\u00e9cisions de r\u00e9vision de 2021 et de 2023 \u00e0 son avis d\u2019appel, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb se fier au dossier de la Commission. Elle aurait d\u00fb demander des pr\u00e9cisions au prestataire. Elle aurait d\u00fb lui demander quelle d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision il portait en appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLa division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis des erreurs de comp\u00e9tence et de droit en m\u00e9langeant deux questions diff\u00e9rentes [25] M\u00eame si cette pr\u00e9occupation est sans objet puisque la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 la mauvaise question, je remarque que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a aussi commis une erreur de droit lorsqu\u2019elle a conclu qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas antidater la demande du prestataire en raison de l\u2019article 52(2) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\n[26] L\u2019article 52(2) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social permet \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour faire appel devant elle. Il ne porte pas sur le fait de savoir si une partie prestataire peut antidater sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi.\n[27] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tait saisie de deux questions succinctes :\na) L\u2019appel du prestataire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale avait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 temps? Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pouvait-elle prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour faire appel? b) Le prestataire pouvait-il antidater sa demande de prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011emploi du 6 janvier 2021 au 27 ao\u00fbt 2020?\n[28] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a m\u00e9lang\u00e9 les deux questions.\n[29] Comme la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a jug\u00e9 que le prestataire avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son appel en retard, elle aurait d\u00fb conclure qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour lui permettre de faire appel. Cela aurait d\u00fb mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019affaire.\n[30] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019avait m\u00eame pas comp\u00e9tence pour trancher la question d\u2019antidatation.\n[31] Si l\u2019appel du prestataire n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en retard de plus d\u2019un an, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait pu prolonger le d\u00e9lai pour faire appel. Cependant, elle n\u2019aurait pas eu la comp\u00e9tence n\u00e9cessaire pour antidater un appel tardif.\nR\u00e9paration [32] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 la mauvaise d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision.\n[33] Habituellement, une telle erreur exigerait que je renvoie l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour qu\u2019elle puisse trancher les questions (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les questions de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et de r\u00e9partition) qu\u2019elle aurait d\u00fb trancher en premier lieu.\n[34] Toutefois, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire.\n[35] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le prestataire a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un double appel \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le 10 octobre 2023, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu une d\u00e9cision concernant l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision rendue par la Commission le 27 avril 2023 (dossier GE\u201123\u20111437). Le prestataire a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devant la division d\u2019appel (dossier AD\u201123\u2011982). La division d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 la permission de faire appel au prestataire.\n[36] Le prestataire souhaite toujours faire appel de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 27 avril 2023 dans le cadre d\u2019un double appel qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il ignorait avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux appels distincts.\n[37] Toutefois, les questions en litige et les parties sont les m\u00eames dans les deux appels. De plus, la d\u00e9cision rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le 10 octobre 2023 est d\u00e9finitive.\n[38] Comme les questions ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, celle-ci ne peut pas instruire de nouveau l\u2019appel, m\u00eame par une ou un autre membreNote de bas de page 9. Je ne vois aucune utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 renvoyer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le r\u00e9sultat le plus judicieux est de rejeter compl\u00e8tement l\u2019affaire.\nConclusion [39] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a tranch\u00e9 la mauvaise question (dossier GE\u201123\u20111439), mais elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 abord\u00e9 les questions sous-jacentes dans un autre appel (dossier GE\u201123\u20111437). L\u2019appel est rejet\u00e9 pour cette raison.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir l\u2019avis d\u2019appel avec la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 27 avril 2023 \u00e0 la page GD2\u20113 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale au paragraphe 8.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 21 janvier 2021 \u00e0 la page GD2\u201118.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir la d\u00e9cision initiale dat\u00e9e du 21 novembre 2022 \u00e0 la page GD2\u201112.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision dat\u00e9e du 27 avril 2023 \u00e0 la page GD2\u20113.\nNote de bas de page 6\nLa Commission de l\u2019assurance-emploi du Canada n\u2019a pas fourni \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale la deuxi\u00e8me page de sa d\u00e9cision du 21 novembre 2022.

Il cesse de travailler du 6 juin 2021 au 19 f\u00e9vrier 2022, parce qu\u2019il est cong\u00e9 parental. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, il re\u00e7oit des prestations du R\u00e9gime qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois d\u2019assurance parentale.\n[3] Par la suite, le prestataire demande \u00e0 recevoir des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi pour proche aidant, afin de soutenir sa m\u00e8re. L\u2019appelante (Commission) lui accorde 15 semaines de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, soit du 20 f\u00e9vrier 2022 au 4 juin 2022.\n[4] Le 5 juin 2022, le prestataire demande \u00e0 recevoir des prestations de compassion pour \u00eatre aupr\u00e8s de sa m\u00e8re.\n[5] La Commission refuse de lui verser des prestations de compassion parce qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re que le prestataire n\u2019a pas accumul\u00e9 suffisamment d\u2019heures d\u2019emploi assurable pendant la p\u00e9riode de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, soit entre le 6 juin 2021 et le 4 juin 2022.\n[6] Le prestataire demande \u00e0 la Commission de r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision. Il soutient que la p\u00e9riode de prestations devrait commencer le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2022 qui correspond au d\u00e9but de sa p\u00e9riode de prestations pour proche aidant et qu\u2019il pouvait demander un autre type de prestations sp\u00e9ciales.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9vis\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en date du 13 octobre 2022, la Commission lui accorde des prestations pour compassion. Il peut recevoir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 26 semaines de prestations pour compassion \u00e0 partir du 5 juin 2022 au taux de 595 $ par semaine.\n[8] Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2022, la Commission contacte le prestataire pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019elle doit infirmer sa d\u00e9cision puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une erreur de sa part. Le prestataire doit donc rembourser la totalit\u00e9 des prestations pour compassion. Le prestataire a port\u00e9 en appel la d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[9] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que la Commission n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 correctement son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa propre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision. Il n\u2019y avait donc pas lieu de d\u00e9cider si le prestataire avait le droit de recevoir des prestations pour compassion.\n[10] La permission d\u2019en appeler a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission. Elle soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a err\u00e9 en droit.\n[11] Je dois d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que la Commission n\u2019a pas correctement exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa propre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision.\n[12] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel de la Commission.\nQuestion en litige [13] Est-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que la Commission n\u2019a pas correctement exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa propre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision?\nAnalyse Mandat de la division d\u2019appel [14] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la division d\u2019appel n\u2019avait d\u2019autre mandat que celui qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par les articles 55 \u00e0 69 de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.Note de bas page 1\n[15] La division d\u2019appel agit \u00e0 titre de tribunal administratif d\u2019appel eu \u00e9gard aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et n\u2019exerce pas un pouvoir de surveillance de la nature de celui qu\u2019exerce une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[16] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'ait pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, qu'elle ait err\u00e9 en droit ou qu'elle ait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, je dois rejeter l'appel.\nEst-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en concluant que la Commission n\u2019a pas correctement exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa propre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision? [17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner sa propre d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision.\n[18] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission peut seulement proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un nouvel examen, selon l\u2019article 52 de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur l\u2019AE), que si une erreur, qui n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9vis\u00e9e, peut \u00eatre d\u00e9cel\u00e9e.\n[19] Dans un cas d'application de l'article 52 de la Loi sur l\u2019AE, un prestataire peut avoir agi et touch\u00e9 des prestations de bonne foi alors qu'on s'aper\u00e7oit par la suite qu'il ne rencontrait pas les crit\u00e8res de la Loi sur l\u2019AE ou \u00e9tait inadmissible \u00e0 recevoir ces prestations.\n[20] Le l\u00e9gislateur, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public, a permis le r\u00e9examen de la demande de prestations. Mais par souci d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de finalit\u00e9, il a exig\u00e9 que celui- ci s'effectue dans les trente-six (36) mois du moment o\u00f9 les prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es ou sont devenues payables.\n[21] La jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli que la seule restriction au pouvoir de r\u00e9examen de la Commission en vertu de l'article 52 de la Loi sur l'AE est le d\u00e9lai.Note de bas page 2 Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission peut r\u00e9examiner une demande en vertu de l\u2019article 52, m\u00eame s'il n'y a pas de faits nouveaux.\n[22] En d'autres termes, la Commission peut retirer son approbation ant\u00e9rieure et exiger des prestataires qu'ils remboursent les prestations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es en vertu de cette approbation.\n[23] Le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'art. 52 n'est pas limit\u00e9 au r\u00e9examen de d\u00e9cisions en tant que telles car il habilite la Commission \u00e0 examiner de nouveau \u00ab toute demande \u00bb au sujet de laquelle des prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es ou auraient d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. Le r\u00e9examen d'une demande entra\u00eene le r\u00e9examen du droit aux prestations.Note de bas page 3\n[24] Je suis donc d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur en droit en d\u00e9terminant que la Commission ne pouvait retirer son approbation \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9cision en r\u00e9vision favorable au prestataire. Elle a \u00e9galement commis une erreur de droit en d\u00e9terminant que la Commission peut seulement proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un nouvel examen, selon l\u2019article 52, que si une erreur, qui n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9vis\u00e9e est d\u00e9cel\u00e9e.Note de bas page 4\n[25] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire puisqu\u2019elle a simplement indiqu\u00e9 au prestataire qu\u2019elle avait commis une erreur dans sa d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9vision. Elle n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 le prestataire de sa d\u00e9marche ni des raisons pour lesquelles elle se serait tromp\u00e9e.\n[26] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance.\n[27] Le processus de r\u00e9examen pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LAE comporte quatre \u00e9tapes qui doivent \u00eatre achev\u00e9es dans les d\u00e9lais prescrits par la loi : i) la Commission doit d\u00e9cider d\u2019exercer ou non son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9examiner; ii) prendre la nouvelle d\u00e9cision; iii) calculer le montant \u00e0 recouvrer ou \u00e0 payer; et iv) aviser le prestataire de la d\u00e9cision.\n[28] La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Commission a accord\u00e9 au prestataire des prestations pour compassion \u00e0 partir du 5 juin 2022. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9examiner, a pris la nouvelle d\u00e9cision, a calcul\u00e9 le montant \u00e0 payer et a avis\u00e9 le prestataire de la d\u00e9cision, oralement et par \u00e9crit, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2022. Un avis de dette lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2022. La Commission a respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai de 36 mois pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\n[29] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement commis une erreur en ne se pronon\u00e7ant pas sur le refus par la Commission de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de prestations du prestataire et de lui verser des prestations de compassion.\n[30] Je suis donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir.\nRem\u00e8de [31] Le dossier devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9tant complet, je suis en mesures de rendre la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[32] La jurisprudence a \u00e9tabli que la seule restriction au pouvoir de r\u00e9examen de la Commission en vertu de l'article 52 de la Loi sur l'AE est le d\u00e9lai. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission peut r\u00e9examiner une demande en vertu de l\u2019article 52, m\u00eame s'il n'y a pas de faits nouveaux.\n[33] Le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'art. 52 n'est pas limit\u00e9 au r\u00e9examen de d\u00e9cisions en tant que telles car il habilite la Commission \u00e0 examiner de nouveau \u00ab toute demande \u00bb au sujet de laquelle des prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es ou auraient d\u00fb l'\u00eatre. Le r\u00e9examen d'une demande entra\u00eene le r\u00e9examen du droit aux prestations.\n[34] La Commission a accord\u00e9 au prestataire des prestations pour compassion \u00e0 partir du 5 juin 2022. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9examiner, a pris la nouvelle d\u00e9cision, calcul\u00e9 le montant \u00e0 payer et avis\u00e9 le prestataire de la d\u00e9cision, oralement et par \u00e9crit, le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2022. Un avis de dette lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 exp\u00e9di\u00e9 le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2022. La Commission a donc respect\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai de 36 mois pr\u00e9vu par la loi.\n[35] Cependant, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019examiner \u00e0 nouveau une demande en vertu de l'article 52 est une d\u00e9cision discr\u00e9tionnaire. Cela signifie que bien que la Commission ait le pouvoir de demander la v\u00e9rification d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 ou de r\u00e9examiner une demande, elle n'a pas \u00e0 le faire.\n[36] La loi pr\u00e9voit que les pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires doivent \u00eatre exerc\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re judiciaire. Cela signifie que lorsque la Commission d\u00e9cide de reconsid\u00e9rer une demande, elle ne peut agir de mauvaise foi ou dans un but ou motif ill\u00e9gitime, tenir compte d'un facteur non pertinent ou ignorer un facteur pertinent ou agir de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire.\n[37] La Commission a \u00e9labor\u00e9 une politique pour l'aider \u00e0 exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de r\u00e9examiner des d\u00e9cisions en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi sur l'AE.\n[38] La Commission affirme que la raison de la politique est \u00ab d'assurer une application uniforme et \u00e9quitable de l'article 52 de la Loi sur l'AE et d'emp\u00eacher la cr\u00e9ation de dettes lorsque le prestataire a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 en trop sans qu'il y ait eu faute de sa part \u00bb. La politique pr\u00e9voit qu'une r\u00e9clamation ne sera r\u00e9examin\u00e9e que lorsque survient l\u2019une des situations suivantes:\nil y a un moins-pay\u00e9 de prestations; des prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es contrairement \u00e0 la structure de la loi; des prestations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une d\u00e9claration fausse ou trompeuse; le prestataire aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019il recevait des prestations auxquelles il n\u2019avait pas droit.\n[39] Il n\u2019y a aucun doute que les prestations de compassion ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es au prestataire contrairement \u00e0 la structure de la Loi sur l'AE.Note de bas page 5\n[40] Je suis d\u2019avis que la Commission a utilis\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on judiciaire suivant l\u2019article 52 de la Loi sur l\u2019AE. La Commission a tenu compte de tous les renseignements pertinents pour examiner de nouveau la demande du prestataire. Aucun nouveau fait pertinent n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni \u00e0 l'audience de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que le prestataire n'ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni \u00e0 la Commission. Rien n'indique que la Commission ait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 des informations non pertinentes ou ait agi de mauvaise foi ou de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire. La Commission a \u00e9galement agi dans un but l\u00e9gitime en r\u00e9examinant le droit du prestataire aux prestations.\n[41] Malgr\u00e9 la sympathie que j\u2019\u00e9prouve pour le prestataire, la loi ne permet pas de prolonger la p\u00e9riode de prestations, et n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ni la division d\u2019appel, le pouvoir d\u2019accorder une prolongation de cette p\u00e9riode, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment des circonstances particuli\u00e8res entourant la situation d\u2019un prestataire.Note de bas page 6\n[42] Il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel de la Commission.\nConclusion [43] L\u2019appel est accueilli. La Commission a utilis\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de mani\u00e8re judiciaire et la prolongation de la p\u00e9riode de prestations et le versement des prestations de compassion n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nCanada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c Jean, 2015 CAF 242; Maunder c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 274.\nNote de bas de page 2\nBrisebois c Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'immigration), A-582-79, Bri\u00e8re c Commission, (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), A-637-86.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir entre autres, Calder c M.E.I., (1980) 1 FC 842, A-233-79.\nNote de bas de page 4\nLe Guide de la d\u00e9termination d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 Chapitre 17 \u2013 Section 17.6.1.1 pr\u00e9voit que la Commission peut \u00e9galement r\u00e9examiner une erreur non li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9vis\u00e9e. Elle doit alors appliquer la politique de r\u00e9examen pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 17.3.3.\nNote de bas de page 5\nL\u2019article 10(2) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi tipule qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de prestations est de 52 semaines.

La derni\u00e8re semaine renouvelable du prestataire \u00e9tait donc la semaine du 29 mai 2022, tel que prescrit par l\u2019article 10(8) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le prestataire n'ayant pas re\u00e7u de prestations de compassion dans sa p\u00e9riode de prestations initiale du 6 juin 2021 au 4 juin 2022, il n'\u00e9tait pas en droit de profiter d'une prolongation de la p\u00e9riode de prestations afin de commencer \u00e0 recevoir des prestations de compassion au-del\u00e0 du 4 juin 2022.\nNote de bas de page 6\nLe prestataire pourrait s\u2019adresser \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de Revenu du Canada afin de demander la d\u00e9falcation de la dette en invoquant que la situation lui cr\u00e9e un pr\u00e9judice abusif.\n",

L\u2019intim\u00e9e (Commission) a examin\u00e9 les raisons du prestataire pour quitter son emploi. Elle a conclu que ce dernier a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il a choisi de quitter son emploi) sans justification pr\u00e9vue par la loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission ne pouvait pas lui verser de prestations.\n[3] Le prestataire a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision. La Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. Le prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire avait d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire aurait pu communiquer avec la CNESST ou consulter un avocat ou m\u00e9decin avant de quitter son emploi. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi.\n[5] Le prestataire a obtenu la permission d\u2019en appeler de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 les lois sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re et ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9pression pour conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\n[6] Je dois d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi (Loi sur L\u2019AE).\n[7] J\u2019accueille l\u2019appel du prestataire.\nQuestion en litige [8] Est-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE ?\nAnalyse Mandat de la division d\u2019appel [9] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la division d\u2019appel n\u2019avait d\u2019autre mandat que celui qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par les articles 55 \u00e0 69 de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.Note de bas de page 1\n[10] La division d\u2019appel agit \u00e0 titre de tribunal administratif d\u2019appel eu \u00e9gard aux d\u00e9cisions rendues par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et n\u2019exerce pas un pouvoir de surveillance de la nature de celui qu\u2019exerce une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\n[11] En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 moins que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n'ait pas observ\u00e9 un principe de justice naturelle, qu'elle ait err\u00e9 en droit ou qu'elle ait fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, le Tribunal doit rejeter l'appel.\nRemarques pr\u00e9liminaires [12] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que je dois prendre en consid\u00e9ration que la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. En effet, une audience devant la division d\u2019appel n\u2019est pas une nouvelle opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. Les pouvoirs de la division d\u2019appel sont limit\u00e9s par la loi.Note de bas de page 2\nEst-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur une conclusion de fait erron\u00e9e, tir\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance, et err\u00e9 dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE ? [13] Le prestataire fait valoir que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a ignor\u00e9 les lois sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re et ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de d\u00e9pression pour conclure qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter son emploi.\n[14] Le prestataire fait valoir que son employeur mettait sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en jeu en n\u2019effectuant pas les r\u00e9parations n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 son camion de livraison. Il soutient que le camion n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 circuler sur la route. Malgr\u00e9 un ultimatum \u00e0 l\u2019employeur, il restait encore des r\u00e9parations \u00e0 faire lors de son d\u00e9part.\n[15] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait d\u00e9terminer si le prestataire \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi au moment o\u00f9 il l\u2019a quitt\u00e9.\n[16] Un prestataire est fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi si, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, son d\u00e9part constitue la seule solution raisonnable dans son cas.\n[17] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire a quitt\u00e9 son emploi. La preuve d\u00e9montre que l\u2019emploi a effectivement pris fin lorsque le prestataire a cess\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail.\n[18] Le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 que son camion de 40 pieds n\u2019\u00e9tait pas s\u00e9curitaire. Il a d\u00fb demander \u00e0 son employeur de le r\u00e9parer \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Il a finalement exp\u00e9di\u00e9 un courriel d\u2019ultimatum \u00e0 son employeur.\n[19] Le courriel, dat\u00e9 du 14 juillet 2022, contient une liste de demandes de r\u00e9parations devant \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019employeur. Le prestataire y inscrit que, pour sa propre s\u00e9curit\u00e9, il ne fera plus de livraisons avec le v\u00e9hicule si ces r\u00e9parations ne sont pas effectu\u00e9es.\n[20] L\u2019employeur a confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission que le camion a d\u00fb \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9. Le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 que le camion n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9par\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son ultimatum, puisqu\u2019il restait la question des pneus et des lumi\u00e8res de nuit du camion.\n[21] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable pour le prestataire de communiquer avec la CNESST ou un avocat au sujet de ses conditions de travail. Elle a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que le prestataire aurait pu obtenir un billet m\u00e9dical avant de quitter son emploi.\n[22] Je suis d\u2019avis que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sans tenir compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments port\u00e9s \u00e0 sa connaissance et qu\u2019elle a err\u00e9 en droit dans son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE.\n[23] La preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un ultimatum, l\u2019employeur n\u2019avait toujours pas r\u00e9par\u00e9 les lumi\u00e8res de nuit du camion de 40 pieds, sauf les clignotants. Il existait toujours un probl\u00e8me avec les pneus qui ne cessait de se d\u00e9gonfler. L\u2019employeur insistait aupr\u00e8s du prestataire afin qu\u2019il conduise son camion sur la route alors qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas conforme aux r\u00e8gles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[24] Cette version du prestataire n\u2019est pas contredite puisque l\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite aux appels de la Commission.\n[25] Le Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re (CSR) pr\u00e9voit que tout propri\u00e9taire ne peut laisser circuler un v\u00e9hicule qui pr\u00e9sente une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 majeure.Note de bas de page 3 Le CSR pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que le prestataire ne pouvait l\u00e9galement conduire un v\u00e9hicule lourd qui pr\u00e9sente une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 majeure.Note de bas de page 4\n[26] Il est facile de conclure que les lumi\u00e8res d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule lourd de 40 pieds qui ne fonctionne pas la nuit constitue une d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 majeure et que de permettre la circulation d\u2019un tel v\u00e9hicule met en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du prestataire et celle d\u2019autrui.\n[27] La preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a quitt\u00e9 son emploi compte tenu des pratiques de l\u2019employeur contraire au droit et parce que ses conditions de travail \u00e9taient dangereuses pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9.Note de bas de page 5\n[28] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable pour la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019exiger que le prestataire contacte la CNESST ou un avocat au sujet de ses conditions de travail avant de quitter puisque la preuve d\u00e9montre clairement que l'employeur exploitait son entreprise en ne tenant aucunement compte de l\u2019ensemble des probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition par le prestataire et en ignorant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment les exigences de la loi en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re.\n[29] Je suis donc justifi\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir.\nRem\u00e8de [30] Consid\u00e9rant que les parties ont eu l'opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur cause devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, je rendrai la d\u00e9cision qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendue par la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.Note de bas de page 6\n[31] Un prestataire ne doit pas d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune autre solution que de quitter son emploi. Son fardeau de preuve exige plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune autre solution raisonnable que de quitter en tenant compte de toutes les circonstances de son cas.\n[32] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rante d\u00e9montre que le prestataire n\u2019avait pas d\u2019autres solutions raisonnables que de quitter son emploi compte tenu des pratiques ill\u00e9gales de son employeur qui avait pour effet de mettre sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en jeu.\n[33] La preuve d\u00e9montre que le prestataire a tout essay\u00e9 pour sauver son emploi. Il a discut\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises avec son employeur de la mauvaise condition de son camion avant de finalement quitter son emploi.\n[34] L\u2019employeur ne respectait pas la loi et n\u2019avait aucunement l\u2019intention de changer dans l\u2019imm\u00e9diat ses conditions de travail, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un ultimatum. Il insistait que le prestataire reprenne la route m\u00eame en sachant que les lumi\u00e8res de nuit du camion de 40 pieds \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueuses et que les pneus \u00e9taient dangereux.\n[35] Le prestataire devait travailler des heures irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res et pouvait \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler en tout temps sur des petits quarts de travail. Il n'avait pas de temps pour postuler un emploi ou pour aller \u00e0 une entrevue. Il n'avait pas de temps pour lui-m\u00eame car il demeurait disponible \u00e0 tout moment pour aller livrer. Son emploi l'occupait beaucoup et il devait \u00eatre disponible pour son employeur sept jours sur sept. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9galement pas requis que le prestataire obtienne une note m\u00e9dicale puisqu\u2019il a reconnu certains sympt\u00f4mes de d\u00e9pression et a agi de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9ventive afin d\u2019\u00e9viter de sombrer une nouvelle fois.\n[36] Je suis d\u2019avis que de demander au prestataire de demeurer \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de cet employeur dans un tel contexte de travail est contraire aux exigences de l\u2019article 29(c) de la Loi sur l\u2019AE.\n[37] Pour les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment mentionn\u00e9s, il y a lieu d\u2019accueillir l\u2019appel du prestataire.\nConclusion [38] L\u2019appel est accueilli.

L\u2019appel ne se poursuivra pas. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision.\nAper\u00e7u [2] L. B., la requ\u00e9rante, a subi deux accidents de travail. Elle a demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada en 2005. Le ministre de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social a rejet\u00e9 sa demande. Elle a fait appel devant le tribunal de r\u00e9vision, ainsi d\u00e9nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. En 2008, apr\u00e8s une audience, le tribunal de r\u00e9vision a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante, concluant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas fait appel.\n[3] En avril 2022, la requ\u00e9rante a de nouveau demand\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait incapable de travailler depuis 2005 en raison de son invalidit\u00e9. Le ministre a rejet\u00e9 apr\u00e8s un examen initial, puis aussi apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision. La requ\u00e9rante a alors fait appel au Tribunal de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale.\n[4] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019appel de la requ\u00e9rante, en appliquant la r\u00e8gle qui interdit de trancher une question qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. C\u2019est le principe de la chose jug\u00e9e.\nQuestion en litige [5] Voici les questions \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire :\na) La requ\u00e9rante a-t-elle invoqu\u00e9 un argument d\u00e9fendable voulant que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait en ignorant sa preuve m\u00e9dicale? b) La requ\u00e9rante pr\u00e9sente-t-elle, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale?\nJe n\u2019accorde pas \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel [6] Je peux accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle montre, dans sa demande, qu\u2019il est d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale :\nn\u2019a pas men\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure \u00e9quitable; a outrepass\u00e9 ses pouvoirs ou a refus\u00e9 de les exercer; a commis une erreur de droit; a commis une erreur de fait; a commis une erreur en appliquant le droit aux faitsNote de bas de page 1.\n[7] Je peux \u00e9galement donner \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel si elle pr\u00e9sente, dans sa demande, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 2.\n[8] Comme la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 un argument d\u00e9fendable ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui justifieraient d\u2019accorder la permission de faire appel, je dois lui refuser la permission de faire appel.\nIl n\u2019est pas d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur de fait en ignorant la preuve m\u00e9dicale de la requ\u00e9rante [9] La requ\u00e9rante soutient que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur de fait en ignorant sa preuve m\u00e9dicale, en particulier ses rapports m\u00e9dicaux r\u00e9cents (y compris les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019une radiographie et d\u2019une imagerie par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique). Elle explique qu\u2019elle a des douleurs qui persistent toujours depuis son accident de travail. La douleur s\u2019est aggrav\u00e9e au fil du tempsNote de bas de page 3.\n[10] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a, dans les faits, trait\u00e9 d\u2019un rapport d\u2019imagerie d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2021 et de l\u2019imagerie par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2023 de la requ\u00e9ranteNote de bas de page 4.\n[11] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a toutefois conclu que ces rapports ne permettaient pas la requ\u00e9rante \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019audience de 2008, devant le tribunal de r\u00e9vision, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 in\u00e9quitableNote de bas de page 5.\n[12] Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aurait ignor\u00e9 ces rapports. Je comprends que la requ\u00e9rante souhaiterait que ces nouveaux rapports soient au centre de l\u2019instruction de son appel en invalidit\u00e9. Toutefois, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a appliqu\u00e9 la loi emp\u00eachant de juger une affaire qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e. Les rapports sont sans incidence sur cette analyse. La requ\u00e9rante n\u2019a pas montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendable que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ait commis une erreur en examinant ces rapports.\n[13] La requ\u00e9rante avait \u00e9galement fourni des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, juste apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience du 19 novembre 2024Note de bas de page 6. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante pour lui expliquer qu\u2019elle n\u2019examinerait pas cette preuve tardive parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pertinente \u00e0 la question de savoir si elle devait appliquer la r\u00e8gle interdisant de trancher une question ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9eNote de bas de page 7. Refuser d\u2019examiner ces rapports d\u00e9pos\u00e9s tardivement, ce n\u2019est pas comme commettre une erreur de fait en les ignorant. Encore une fois, la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pertinents pour la question qu\u2019elle devait trancherNote de bas de page 8.\nAucun nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne justifie d\u2019accorder la permission de faire appel [14] La requ\u00e9rante a joint des documents m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 sa demande \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel. La presque totalit\u00e9 de ces rapports avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9raleNote de bas de page 9. Le seul nouveau rapport, je crois, serait le rapport d\u2019imagerie par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique de son \u00e9paule droite, qui date de 2022Note de bas de page 10.\n[15] Le rapport d\u2019imagerie par r\u00e9sonance magn\u00e9tique de 2022 n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 la question que je dois trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Je dois d\u00e9cider si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir commis une erreur en appliquant la r\u00e8gle interdisant de juger une chose d\u00e9j\u00e0 jug\u00e9e.\n[16] En 2008, le tribunal de r\u00e9vision a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la requ\u00e9rante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas grave au sens du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada au terme de sa p\u00e9riode de couverture, en 2007. Le rapport d\u2019imagerie de 2022 n\u2019est d\u2019aucune aide pour savoir si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a commis une erreur dans sa d\u00e9cision. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a strictement examin\u00e9 si elle pouvait trancher la m\u00eame question que celle qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite et tranch\u00e9e par le tribunal de r\u00e9vision. Ce rapport d\u2019imagerie de 2022 date de nombreuses ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance de la p\u00e9riode de protection de la requ\u00e9rante. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 fait des ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du tribunal de r\u00e9vision concernant l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de la requ\u00e9rante pendant sa p\u00e9riode de protection.\n[17] Comme le rapport n\u2019est d\u2019aucune utilit\u00e9 pour savoir si la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pourrait avoir err\u00e9, il ne peut justifier d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel.\n[18] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 le dossier du pr\u00e9sent appelNote de bas de page 11. Je suis convaincue que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas ignor\u00e9 ou mal compris la preuve lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas juger la m\u00eame question que celle qu\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e le tribunal de r\u00e9vision. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a examin\u00e9 et appliqu\u00e9 la preuve disponible au droit relatif au principe de la chose jug\u00e9eNote de bas de page 12. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 attentivement si l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle interdisant de trancher une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e causerait une injustice.\nConclusion [19] J\u2019ai refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019appel ne se poursuivra pas.\nNotes de bas de page\nNote de bas de page 1\nVoir les articles 58.1(a) et (b) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 2\nVoir l\u2019article 58.1(c) de la Loi sur le minist\u00e8re de l\u2019Emploi et du D\u00e9veloppement social.\nNote de bas de page 3\nVoir la page AD1-4 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 4\nVoir les paragraphes 29 \u00e0 31 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, qui traitent des documents aux pages GD2-187, GD2-180, GD6-2, GD2-183 et GD2-186 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 5\nVoir les paragraphes 29 \u00e0 32 de la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nNote de bas de page 6\nVoir le document GD7 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 7\nVoir le document GD8 du dossier d\u2019appel.\nNote de bas de page 8\nJ\u2019ai examin\u00e9 si le refus de ces rapports tardifs donnait possiblement lieu \u00e0 une autre erreur qui justifierait d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la requ\u00e9rante la permission de faire appel. Je ne peux pas conclure que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas men\u00e9 un processus \u00e9quitable, comme elle a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si ces rapports \u00e9taient pertinents et a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019en avait pas tenu compte dans sa d\u00e9cision.\nNote de bas de page 9\nLa requ\u00e9rante a fourni \u00e0 la division d\u2019appel des copies des rapports dont disposait d\u00e9j\u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale aux pages GD2-180, GD6-2, GD2-202, GD2-215 et GD2-287 du dossier d\u2019appel.

Une p\u00e9riode de prestations a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 compter du 6 novembre 2022.\n[4] Le 12 janvier 2023, la d\u00e9fenderesse (Commission) l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019acceptait pas les heures de travail effectu\u00e9es pour le centre hospitalier parce qu\u2019il a quitt\u00e9 volontairement son emploi chez cet employeur, sans motif valable au sens de la loi. Elle lui a impos\u00e9 une exclusion du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des prestations \u00e0 compter du 15 mai 2022.\n[5] Le prestataire a demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision mais la Commission a maintenu sa d\u00e9cision initiale. La prestataire a interjet\u00e9 appel devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[6] La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience en l\u2019absence du prestataire. Elle a conclu que le prestataire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 \u00e0 quitter volontairement son emploi puisqu\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas de la seule solution raisonnable. La division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a maintenu l\u2019exclusion du prestataire \u00e0 compter du 15 mai 2022.\n[7] Au soutien de sa demande pour permission d\u2019en appeler, la prestataire soutient qu\u2019il a tent\u00e9 de se joindre \u00e0 l\u2019audience mais que personne ne lui a r\u00e9pondu. Il aimerait avoir l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de contester la version de son ancien employeur.\nQuestions en litige [8] Est-ce qu\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019accorder la permission d\u2019en appeler?\n[9] Est-ce que la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle?\nAnalyse [10] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9vision du dossier, j\u2019\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de tenir une conf\u00e9rence de r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l\u2019amiable. Le prestataire a expliqu\u00e9 ses d\u00e9marches afin de participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Il a attendu mais n\u2019a pas eu de r\u00e9ponse. D\u00e8s qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u la d\u00e9cision de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande pour permission d\u2019en appeler.\n[11] La Commission n\u2019a pas trouv\u00e9 raison de douter de la version du prestataire. Elle est d\u2019accord que le prestataire n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00eatre entendu et qu\u2019il y a eu un manquement \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle.\n[12] Le concept de \u00ab justice naturelle \u00bb englobe le droit du prestataire \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable. Une audience \u00e9quitable pr\u00e9suppose la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre entendu, le droit de savoir ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 contre la partie, et la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations.\n[13] Je reconnais les efforts de la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale afin de permettre au prestataire d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Je suis quand m\u00eame d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y a eu un manquement \u00e0 un principe de justice naturelle.\n[14] Pour ces raisons, la permission d\u2019en appeler est accord\u00e9e et l\u2019appel du prestataire est accueilli.\nConclusion [15] La permission d\u2019en appeler est accord\u00e9e et l\u2019appel est accueilli. Le dossier retourne \u00e0 la division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour r\u00e9examen.",
