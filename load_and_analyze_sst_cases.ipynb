      "Decision Overview Matter I have to consider first Issue Analysis Conclusion\n",
      "Decision [1] The appeal is dismissed. The Tribunal disagrees with the Appellant.\n",
      "[2] The Appellant hasn’t shown just cause (in other words, a reason the law accepts) for leaving her job when she did. The Appellant didn’t have just cause because she had reasonable alternatives to leaving. This means she is disqualified from receiving Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.\n",
      "Overview [3] The Appellant says she didn’t quit her job. The Appellant worked for an employment agency (employer). The employer placed the Appellant with a business. After working with the business for many months, the business decided they no longer wanted the Appellant to work for them. After that happened, the Appellant says she never heard back from her employment agency employer for other work.\n",
      "[4] The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) decided that because the Appellant didn’t stay in contact with the employer that she voluntarily left. It decided that she voluntarily left (or chose to quit) her job without just cause, so it wasn’t able to pay her benefits.\n",
      "[5] I must decide whether the Appellant has proven that she had no reasonable alternative to leaving her job.\n",
      "[6] The Commission says the Appellant could have stayed in touch with her employer. The employer says they would have found other work for the Appellant.\n",
      "[7] The Appellant disagrees and says she didn’t know it was a requirement for her to stay in contact with the employer. She thought the employer would contact her if there was other work available.\n",
      "Matter I have to consider first This hearing was heard along with GE-23-1872 [8] The Appellant had two cases she had filed an appeal on. To make it easier for the Appellant the two appeals were held on the same hearing day. This means one appeal was heard and then the second appeal was heard. The appeals were treated separately.\n",
      "Issue [9] Did the Appellant voluntarily leave her job?\n",
      "[10] If she voluntarily left, is she disqualified from receiving benefits because she voluntarily left her job without just cause?\n",
      "[11] To answer this, I must first address the Appellant’s voluntary leaving. I then have to decide whether the Appellant had just cause for leaving.\n",
      "Analysis The parties don’t agree that the Appellant voluntarily left [12] If the Appellant had a choice to stay or leave her job, then she voluntarily left.Footnote 1 The Appellant and the Commission do not agree on whether the Appellant had this choice.\n",
      "The Appellant voluntarily left her employment [13] To decide if the Appellant voluntarily left her employment, I must first decide whether or not she had a choice to stay in or leave that employment.Footnote 2\n",
      "[14] The law says that you are disqualified from receiving benefits if you left your job voluntarily and you did not have just cause.Footnote 3\n",
      "[15] The burden of proof is on the Commission to show that the leaving was voluntary.Footnote 4\n",
      "[16] The Appellant worked for an employment placement agency (employer) since January 2022. The employer placed the Appellant at a business in January 2022. In June 2022, the business no longer wished to have the Appellant work for them. The Appellant’s last day with the business was on June 17, 2022.Footnote 5\n",
      "[17] The employer told the Commission that the business had concerns about the Appellant’s attendance. The Appellant doesn’t dispute that she had absences with the business. She says she was sick and had court appearances. However, the Appellant and the business aren’t the issue here.\n",
      "[18] The Appellant agrees the business asked that she no longer come to work for them. The Appellant agrees the last day she worked for the business was on June 17, 2022.\n",
      "[19] The employer says even though the business didn’t want the Appellant, the employer would have found other placements for her.Footnote 6\n",
      "[20] The employer told the Commission the last day they heard from the Appellant was on June 21, 2022.Footnote 7 The employer says it is a requirement of their contractual agreement that employees contact them every seven days to declare their availability and see what opportunities are available.Footnote 8 The employer says they didn’t hear from the Appellant for seven days so they issued a ROE.Footnote 9\n",
      "[21] The Appellant testified she wasn’t aware of any requirement to contact her employer every seven days. Yet, the Commission says the Appellant agreed that this was a requirement.Footnote 10\n",
      "[22] During the hearing the Appellant tried to find her contract with the employer, but was unable to do so. I find it more likely than not that the Appellant may have forgotten what the requirements of her employer were. The Appellant first started working for her employer in January 2022. The Appellant’s application for benefits was more than a year later. The hearing itself was a year and seven months later.\n",
      "[23] As well, the Appellant testified she only had one placement through her employer. This means that the Appellant was at the same place of business from the day she started until June 17, 2022. I find it is more likely than not that the Appellant may have forgotten about the requirement to communicate every seven days. It wasn’t something she had to do for six months because she was at the same placement.\n",
      "[24] I find, on a balance of probabilities, that a term of the employer’s contract required the Appellant to contact the employer every seven days.\n",
      "[25] This means that the Appellant had an option to continue with her employer. All she had to do was let them know that she continued to be available and they would have found placements for her. This means that the Appellant had a choice to stay or go.\n",
      "[26] The employer says they could have kept looking for work for the Appellant. This means the Appellant could have kept working. But she chose not to remain in touch with her employer. This means she was responsible for the separation from her employer. I find this because she had the choice to stay or go. This means it was the Appellant’s actions, not her employer’s, that led to her not having work. I find this means the Appellant voluntarily left her employment.\n",
      "The parties don’t agree that the Appellant had just cause [27] The parties don’t agree the Appellant had just cause for voluntarily leaving her job when she did.\n",
      "[28] The law says you are disqualified from receiving benefits if you left your job voluntarily and you didn’t have just cause.Footnote 11 Having a good reason for leaving a job isn’t enough to prove just cause.\n",
      "[29] The law explains what it means by “just cause.” The law says you have just cause to leave if you had no reasonable alternative to quitting your job when you did. It says that you have to consider all the circumstances.Footnote 12\n",
      "[30] It is up to the Appellant to prove that she had just cause.Footnote 13 She has to prove this on a balance of probabilities. This means she has to show that it is more likely than not that her only reasonable option was to quit. When I decide whether the Appellant had just cause, I have to look at all of the circumstances that existed when the Appellant quit.\n",
      "[31] The Appellant testified she thought she was still employed with her employer. She said she thought if her employer had work for her, they would contact her. But she didn’t hear from them after June 21, 2022.\n",
      "[32] Since the Appellant doesn’t accept that she voluntarily left her employment, it makes it more difficult for her to explain why she had just cause for leaving. Yet, I find the Appellant could have explained why she didn’t remain in contact with her employer.\n",
      "[33] The Appellant testified she didn’t know it was required that she stay in contact with her employer. Yet, I found above that it is more likely than not that this was communicated to the Appellant and she has just forgotten given the passage of time.\n",
      "[34] So, the circumstance that existed for the Appellant was that her placement business didn’t wish to have her continue on there. The last day she worked was June 17, 2022. The employer placement agency didn’t hear from the Appellant after June 21, 2022 and didn’t know she still wanted work.\n",
      "The Appellant had reasonable alternatives [35] The Appellant testified she never left her employer placement agency. Yet, she agrees she didn’t speak with the employer after June 21, 2022.\n",
      "[36] The Commission says the Appellant could have remained employed and working by continuing to communicate with her employer.\n",
      "[37] The Appellant says she assumed the employer would reach out to her if there was work for her.\n",
      "[38] I find that by not communicating with her employer, it meant the employer didn’t know the Appellant was still looking for work. I find the Appellant could have attempted to contact her employer to find out if there were other opportunities. But she didn’t. This means the employer didn’t think she was still interested in finding other work.\n",
      "[39] The Appellant testified the only reason she applied for EI benefits is because she was told she had before she could receive other social assistance. I find the Appellant hasn’t established that she had just cause for failing to remain in touch with her employer. I find that this means she had a reasonable alternative. It would have been reasonable for the Appellant to keep communicating with her employer.\n",
      "[40] Considering the circumstances that existed when the Appellant quit, the Appellant had a reasonable alternative to leaving when she did, for the reasons set out above.\n",
      "[41] This means the Appellant didn’t have just cause for leaving her job.\n",
      "Conclusion [42] I find that the Appellant is disqualified from receiving benefits.\n",
      "[43] This means that the appeal is dismissed.\n",

      "Decision Overview Issue Analysis Conclusion\n",
      "Decision [1] I am refusing permission (leave) to appeal. The appeal won’t proceed.\n",
      "Overview [2] F. A. is the Claimant in this case. The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (Commission) is asking him to pay back $8,500 in Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. Specifically, the Commission says that the Claimant isn’t entitled to the benefits he received from December 14, 2020, because he was absent from Canada.\n",
      "[3] The Claimant appealed the Commission’s decision to the Tribunal’s General Division, but it dismissed his appeal. The Claimant now wants to appeal the General Division decision to the Appeal Division. But before this case can proceed, I must first decide whether to give permission to appeal.\n",
      "[4] I have reviewed the documents the Claimant submitted in support of his appeal carefully and several times. His submissions are repetitive and sometimes confusing. Overall, the Claimant seems to be arguing that the General Division ignored several pieces of evidence and misunderstood others.\n",
      "[5] I have found that the Claimant’s appeal has no reasonable chance of success. I have no choice, then, but to refuse permission to appeal. My reasons for deciding this are explained below.\n",
      "Issue [6] This decision focuses on the following issue: Could the General Division have ignored or misinterpreted evidence in way that could ground a successful appeal?\n",
      "Analysis [7] Appeal Division files follow a two-step process. This appeal is at step one: permission to appeal.\n",
      "[8] The legal test that the Claimant needs to meet at this step is low: Has he raised an arguable case on which the appeal might succeed?Footnote 1 If the appeal has no reasonable chance of success, then I must refuse permission to appeal.Footnote 2\n",
      "The General Division decision isn’t based on a relevant error of fact [9] In general, a person is disqualified from receiving EI benefits for any period during which they are absent from Canada.Footnote 3 But the law recognizes certain exceptions to this general rule.Footnote 4\n",
      "[10] The Claimant was absent from Canada from December 12, 2020, to October 5, 2021. He cites his health as one of his reasons for leaving Canada, specifically high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and other heart and respiratory problems.Footnote 5 It seems that these health problems resolved with significant weight loss.Footnote 6\n",
      "[11] The Claimant intended to return to Canada in January 2021. But several factors beyond his control delayed his return. Specifically, he got infected with COVID-19 in January 2021. After he recovered, his flights were cancelled or delayed several times because of the pandemic and the Canadian border closures.\n",
      "[12] So, the General Division had to decide whether the Claimant was disqualified from receiving EI benefits because of his absence from Canada. Or, did his situation fall within an exception to the general rule?\n",
      "[13] On this point, the General Division identified only one exception that might apply to the Claimant’s situation. Section 55(1)(a) of the Employment Insurance Regulations reads as follows:\n",
      "55 (1) Subject to section 18 of the Act, a claimant who is not a self-employed person is not disentitled from receiving benefits for the reason that the claimant is outside Canada\n",
      "(a) for the purpose of undergoing, at a hospital, medical clinic or similar facility outside Canada, medical treatment that is not readily or immediately available in the claimant’s area of residence in Canada, if the hospital, clinic or facility is accredited to provide the medical treatment by the appropriate governmental authority outside Canada; [emphasis added]\n",
      "[14] However, the submissions before the Appeal Division don’t seem to indicate that the General Division ignored or misinterpreted evidence concerning:\n",
      "treatment received in a medical facility outside Canada; or the unavailability of this treatment in the Claimant’s area of residence.\n",
      "[15] For example, the Claimant submitted several pieces of evidence showing medical tests he had undergone outside Canada, but what treatments did he receive in those medical centres? On the contrary, according to the Claimant, when new medical problems were discovered, he wanted to return to Canada quickly to get treatment.Footnote 7\n",
      "[16] Where is the evidence that the Claimant was treated in a medical centre outside Canada for his high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, or diabetes? Where is the evidence that these treatments aren’t readily or immediately available in his area of residence?\n",
      "[17] Without a possible error related to these points, the Claimant’s appeal has no reasonable chance of success. It is bound to fail.\n",
      "[18] I recognize that the Claimant disputes several of the General Division’s findings, especially about his availability for work. But these errors, if that is what they are, can’t change the outcome of the case. In other words, even if I were to overturn the General Division’s finding about the Claimant’s availability for work, he would still be disqualified from receiving benefits because of the general rule that applies to persons who are absent from Canada.\n",
      "[19] I also recognize that the Claimant’s absence from Canada was extended for reasons entirely beyond his control. But the General Division found that it had no choice but to apply the law.Footnote 8 I see no error here.\n",
      "[20] Applying the law can sometimes give rise to some harsh results that appear to be at odds with the objectives of the EI scheme. But the Tribunal can’t rewrite or circumvent the law, even in sympathetic situations.Footnote 9\n",
      "[21] Aside from the Claimant’s arguments, I have read the appeal file, listened to the audio recording of the General Division hearing, and examined the General Division decision.Footnote 10 But I haven’t noted other reasons to give permission to appeal.\n",
      "Conclusion [22] I have concluded that the Claimant’s appeal has no reasonable chance of success. I have no choice, then, but to refuse permission to appeal. This means that the appeal won’t proceed.\n",

      "On this page\n",
      "Decision Introduction Analysis Conclusion Appendix\n",
      "Decision [1] The Appeal is granted and the matter is referred to the General Division for reconsideration.\n",
      "Introduction [2] The Respondent applied for a Canada Pension Plan disability pension in March 2012. He claimed that he was disabled by a knee injury, ongoing knee pain and limitations. The Applicant denied his claim initially and on reconsideration. The Respondent appealed to the General Division of this Tribunal. On July 2, 2014 the General Division allowed his appeal and granted the Respondent a disability pension.\n",
      "[3] The Applicant sought leave to appeal that decision. On December 1, 2014 I granted leave to appeal, considering three grounds of appeal: that the General Division may have erred in fact in its interpretation of a handwritten medical report, that the General Division erred in concluding that any attempts to work would cause further deterioration to the Respondent’s knee, and that the General Division erred when it did not give reasons for rejecting medical evidence that the Respondent could perform less physically demanding work.\n",
      "[4] I must decide whether the General Division made an error of fact or an error of mixed fact and law such that the appeal should be granted.\n",
      "[5] Pursuant to the Social Security Tribunal Regulations, parties have 45 days from the granting of leave to appeal to file further submissions to support their position. On December 23, 2014 the Respondent filed a letter that stated that he had no more submissions to make. The Respondent filed submissions within the time permitted to do so. I have considered the written material in the file, including submissions and the medical evidence presented to the General Division in reaching my decision.\n",
      "Analysis [6] The Appellant submitted that the proper standard of review for the decision made by the General Division was reasonableness. The Respondent made no submissions on this issue. The leading case that deals with what standard of review should be applied to a decision is Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 2008 SCC 9. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that when reviewing a decision on questions of fact, mixed law and fact, and questions of law related to the tribunal’s own statute, the standard of review is reasonableness; that is, whether the decision of the tribunal is within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible on the facts and the law. I accept the Respondent’s submissions on this issue as a correct statement of the law. Since the alleged errors in this case were errors of fact and errors of mixed fact and law, the standard of review to be applied is that of reasonableness.\n",
      "[7] The Department of Employment and Social Development Act provides for the grounds of appeal that can be considered and the remedies that can be granted by the Appeal Division on an appeal (see Appendix to the decision).\n",
      "[8] The first ground of appeal considered in this case was whether the General Division based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it when it stated that the handwritten word in one medical report was “restricted” as it should have been “motivated”. The Appellant argued that this error influenced the General Division’s decision and was thus a factual error made without regard to the material before it. Leave to appeal was not granted on this ground of appeal however, the parties were invited to make submissions on this. Neither party made any such submissions.\n",
      "[9] Upon review of the material filed before the General Division, I cannot determine whether the General Division erred in its interpretation of the handwriting in this report. The writing is not clear. The General Division decision referred to this report, and also the other evidence presented. I am not persuaded that it based its decision on an error of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it when it considered this. The conclusion reached by the General Division on this issue was reasonable and defensible on the facts and the law. The appeal therefore does not succeed on this ground.\n",
      "[10] The Appellant also argued that the General Division erred when it concluded that any attempts to work would cause the Respondent’s knee to deteriorate without referring to any medical evidence to support this. While it is true that there was no medical evidence to support this contention, the General Division also considered the Respondent’s testimony that he feared his condition would worsen if he attempted other work or retraining, that he could only manage activities of daily living, and of his specific limitations. It was on this basis that the General Division concluded that the Respondent was incapable of regularly pursuing work or retraining, and that his condition would deteriorate if he attempted this. I am not persuaded by the Appellant’s argument that this conclusion, based on all of the evidence, was based on an error of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner, or without regard to the material before it. This conclusion was reasonable and defensible on the facts and the law.\n",
      "[11] The last ground upon which leave to appeal was granted was that the General Division failed to provide reasons for rejecting medical evidence that was contradictory to the conclusion it reached. There are a number of decisions that deal with a tribunal’s obligation to provide sufficient reasons for its decision. In Giannaros v. Canada (Minister of Social Development), 2005 FCA187 the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that in omitting to explain why it rejected a body of credible evidence, the Pension Appeals Board had failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. In this case the General Division did not provide any explanation for rejecting the medical evidence. This evidence was clear that the Respondent should have been able to perform a less physically demanding job. By not providing any explanation for rejecting this evidence, the General Division made an error of mixed fact and law, which renders the decision unreasonable. Hence the appeal must be granted.\n",
      "Conclusion [12] The Appeal is granted for the reasons set out above. The matter is referred back for reconsideration before a different Member of the General Division.\n",
      "Appendix Department of Employment and Social Development Act\n",
      "58. (1) The only grounds of appeal are that\n",
      "(a) the General Division failed to observe a principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; (b) the General Division erred in law in making its decision, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or (c) the General Division based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it.\n",
      "59. (1) The Appeal Division may dismiss the appeal, give the decision that the General Division should have given, refer the matter back to the General Division for reconsideration in accordance with any directions that the Appeal Division considers appropriate or confirm, rescind or vary the decision of the General Division in whole or in part.\n",

      "Decision Overview Issue Preliminary remarks I am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal Conclusion\n",
      "Decision [1] Permission to appeal is not granted. The appeal will not proceed.\n",
      "Overview [2] The Applicant (Claimant) left his job to attend college full-time and applied for Employment Insurance (EI) benefits. The Respondent (Commission) decided that he voluntarily left (or chose to quit) his job without just cause, so it was not able to pay him benefits. The Commission also decided that the Claimant was not available for work while taking training.\n",
      "[3] The Claimant challenged the Commission’s decision, but the Commission upheld its decision on reconsideration. The Claimant appealed to the Tribunal’s General Division.\n",
      "[4] The General Division found that the Claimant quit his job to move closer to his school, which was located 235 km away from his home. It found that he did not have just cause under the law for leaving his job. It decided that he was not entitled to benefits. It did not decide on his availability given its finding on voluntary leaving.\n",
      "Issue [5] The law specifies the only grounds of appeal of a General Division decision. These reviewable errors are the following:\n",
      "The General Division hearing process was not fair in some way. The General Division did not decide an issue it should have decided. Or, it decided something it did not have the power to decide. The General Division based its decision on an important error of fact. The General Division made an error of law when making its decision.\n",
      "[6] An application for permission to appeal is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is an initial hurdle for the Claimant to meet, but it is lower than the one that must be met at the hearing of the appeal on the merits. At the permission to appeal stage, the Claimant does not have to prove his case; he must instead establish that the appeal has a reasonable chance of success. In other words, he has to show that there is arguably a reviewable error based on which the appeal might succeed.\n",
      "[7] I will give permission to appeal if I am satisfied that at least one of the Claimant’s stated grounds of appeal gives the appeal a reasonable chance of success.\n",
      "Preliminary remarks [8] Although the file is in English, the Claimant asked that this decision be written in French.\n",
      "I am not giving the Claimant permission to appeal [9] The Claimant argues that the General Division made the same error as the Commission by focusing on his reason for leaving, without considering his obligation to move. He says that he explored all his options before leaving his job and that he had no choice but to leave, since he could not travel such a distance every day. He applied for at least eight full-time jobs before leaving the Kitchener area.\n",
      "[10] The evidence shows that the Claimant left his job to go back to school. The Record of Employment from the employer says that he quit to go back to school.\n",
      "[11] The Claimant was turned down by the college in Kitchener but was accepted to the one in Peterborough. So, he decided to move because the college in Peterborough was located 235 km away from his home. After resigning, he started looking for full-time jobs in Peterborough.Footnote 1\n",
      "[12] The issue before the General Division was whether the Claimant voluntarily left his job without just cause within the meaning of the Employment Insurance Act (EI Act). This needs to be determined based on the circumstances that existed when the Claimant quit.\n",
      "[13] The General Division found that the Claimant quit his job to move closer to the college in Peterborough, which was located 235 km away from his home. It found that moving to attend school is not just cause for quitting a job. It found that the Claimant could have waited to be accepted to his local college or secured employment in Peterborough before resigning. It did not decide on his availability given its finding on voluntary leaving.\n",
      "[14] It is not disputed that the Claimant is the one who ended his employment. If it had not been for his choice to go back to school, he would have kept his job in Kitchener. He himself stated that he made the decision to move to take a course at the college in Peterborough.\n",
      "[15] The Claimant argues that the General Division failed to consider his obligation to move to Peterborough.\n",
      "[16] As the General Division noted, the Claimant’s obligation to move is the logical consequence of his initial choice to go back to school in an area other than the one he lived in. In other words, there is no obligation to move if he does not go back to school in Peterborough.\n",
      "[17] I find that the General Division properly applied the consistent case law of the Federal Court of Appeal to the effect that a claimant’s voluntarily leaving their employment to go back to school or take training does not amount to “just cause” within the meaning of sections 29 and 30 of the EI Act.Footnote 2\n",
      "[18] In my view, the General Division correctly stated the legal test for voluntary leaving. It applied this test to the facts of the case and looked at whether, after considering all of the circumstances, the Claimant had no reasonable alternative to leaving his job.\n",
      "[19] The Claimant surely made a good decision to further his personal development. However, he did not have just cause for leaving within the meaning of the EI Act.\n",
      "[20] After reviewing the appeal file, the General Division decision, and the arguments in support of the application for permission to appeal, I have no choice but to find that the appeal has no reasonable chance of success.\n",
      "Conclusion [21] Permission to appeal is not granted. This means that the appeal will not proceed.\n",

      "Décision et motifs Décision [1] Le Tribunal refuse la permission d’en appeler à la division d’appel.\n",
      "Aperçu [2] La demanderesse, H. M. (prestataire), a présenté une demande de prestations d’assurance-emploi prenant effet le 8 décembre 2019. La défenderesse, la Commission de l’assurance-emploi du Canada, a jugé que la prestataire était exclue du bénéfice des prestations à compter du 9 décembre 2019 parce qu’elle n’était pas disponible pour travailler. La prestataire a demandé une révision de la décision et la Commission a modifié la décision initiale. Elle a déterminé que la prestataire avait commencé à faire des démarches raisonnables et habituelles pour trouver un emploi convenable à partir du 14 février 2020 et a levé l’inadmissibilité pour une période indéterminée en date du 13 février 2020. La prestataire a interjeté appel à la division générale.\n",
      "[3] La division générale a conclu que la prestataire n’avait pas prouvé qu’elle était capable de travailler et disponible à cette fin et incapable d’obtenir un emploi convenable. Par conséquent, la prestataire a été jugée inadmissible aux prestations conformément à l’article 18(1)(a) de la Loi sur l’assurance-emploi (Loi sur l’AE) pendant la période du 9 décembre 2019 au 13 février 2020.\n",
      "[4] La prestataire demande maintenant la permission d’interjeter appel de la décision de la division générale à la division d’appel. Pour appuyer sa demande de permission d’en appeler, la prestataire affirme que la Commission a tardé à traiter sa demande et que, par conséquent, elle n’a pas reçu en temps utile des renseignements exacts sur sa recherche d’emploi, ce qui rend la question de sa disponibilité nulle. Elle soutient qu’elle a fait des démarches raisonnables et habituelles pour trouver du travail et retourner à l’emploi qu’elle occupait avant sa blessure pendant que l’on tardait à traiter sa demande.\n",
      "[5] Le Tribunal doit déterminer si la division générale a commis une erreur susceptible de révision qui pourrait permettre à l’appel d’être accueilli.\n",
      "[6] Le Tribunal refuse la permission d’en appeler parce que l’appel de la prestataire n’a aucune chance raisonnable de succès.\n",
      "Question en litige [7] La prestataire a-t-elle soulevé une erreur susceptible de révision commise par la division générale qui pourrait permettre à l’appel d’être accueilli?\n",
      "Analyse [8] L’article 58(1) de la Loi sur le ministère de l’Emploi et du Développement social précise les seuls moyens d’interjeter appel d’une décision de la division générale. Ces erreurs susceptibles de révision sont les suivantes :\n",
      "a) la division générale n’a pas observé un principe de justice naturelle ou a autrement excédé ou refusé d’exercer sa compétence;\n",
      "b) elle a rendu une décision entachée d’une erreur de droit, que l’erreur ressorte ou non à la lecture du dossier;\n",
      "c) elle a fondé sa décision sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments portés à sa connaissance.\n",
      "[9] La demande de permission d’en appeler est une étape préliminaire à une audience sur le fond. C’est une première étape que la partie prestataire doit franchir, mais le fardeau est inférieur à celui dont elle devra s’acquitter à l’audience relative à l’appel sur le fond. À l’étape de la demande de permission d’en appeler, la partie prestataire n’a pas à prouver sa thèse, mais elle doit établir que son appel a une chance raisonnable de succès parce qu’une erreur susceptible de révision a été commise.\n",
      "[10] Autrement dit, pour accorder la permission d’interjeter appel, le Tribunal doit être convaincu que les motifs d’appel correspondent à au moins un des moyens d’appel susmentionnés et qu’au moins un des motifs a une chance raisonnable de succès en appel.\n",
      "La prestataire soulève-t-elle une erreur susceptible de révision commise par la division générale qui pourrait permettre à l’appel d’être accueilli? [11] Pour appuyer sa demande de permission d’en appeler, la prestataire affirme que la Commission a tardé à traiter sa demande et qu’elle n’a donc pas reçu en temps utile des renseignements exacts sur sa recherche d’emploi, ce qui rend la question de sa disponibilité nulle. Elle soutient qu’elle a fait des démarches raisonnables et habituelles pour trouver du travail et retourner à l’emploi qu’elle occupait avant sa blessure pendant que l’on tardait à traiter sa demande.\n",
      "[12] La prestataire a choisi de ne pas assister à l’audience de la division générale. Le Tribunal a expliqué à la prestataire dans une lettre qu’un appel devant la division d’appel n’est pas une occasion de présenter de nouveaux éléments de preuve et de plaider à nouveau sa cause. La division d’appel doit statuer sur la présente demande en fonction des éléments de preuve présentés à la division générale.\n",
      "[13] Afin d’être admissible à des prestations, une partie prestataire doit prouver qu’elle est capable de travailler et disponible à cette fin, et incapable de trouver un emploi convenable et cela, pour tout jour ouvrableNote de bas page 1.\n",
      "[14] Puisque la Loi sur l’AE ne fournit aucune définition précise, la Cour d’appel fédérale a déclaré à de nombreuses occasions que la disponibilité doit être déterminée en examinant trois facteurs :\n",
      "le désir de retourner sur le marché du travail aussitôt qu’un emploi convenable est offert; l’expression de ce désir par des démarches pour trouver un emploi convenable; le non-établissement de conditions personnelles pouvant limiter indûment les chances de retourner sur le marché du travailNote de bas page 2.\n",
      "[15] De plus, la disponibilité est déterminée pour chaque jour ouvrable d’une période de prestations pour lequel la partie prestataire peut prouver qu’elle était capable de travailler et disponible à cette fin et incapable d’obtenir un emploi convenableNote de bas page 3.\n",
      "[16] La division générale a déterminé que la prestataire n’avait pas prouvé qu’elle désirait retourner sur le marché du travail aussitôt qu’un emploi convenable était disponible. Elle a jugé que la prestataire n’avait fait que deux demandes d’emploi en un peu plus de deux mois.\n",
      "[17] La division générale a aussi estimé que les démarches de la prestataire pour trouver un emploi convenable n’étaient pas suffisantes étant donné qu’elles consistaient principalement à s’inscrire à des alertes d’emploi et à postuler à deux emplois dans une période de deux mois.\n",
      "[18] La division générale a finalement déterminé que la prestataire n’avait pas fixé de condition personnelle qui aurait pu limiter indûment ses chances de retourner sur le marché du travail en limitant sa recherche à un emploi à temps plein. Elle a jugé qu’il y avait de nombreux emplois à temps plein disponibles pour le type de travail que la prestataire recherchait.\n",
      "[19] La division générale a conclu que la prestataire n’avait pas prouvé qu’elle était capable de travailler et disponible à cette fin et incapable de trouver un emploi convenable. Bien qu’elle n’ait pas fixé de condition personnelle qui aurait pu limiter indûment ses chances de retourner sur le marché du travail au cours de la période allant du 9 décembre 2019 au 13 février 2020, la prestataire n’a pas manifesté le désir de retourner sur le marché du travail dès que possible et n’a pas exprimé ce désir par ses démarches pour trouver un emploi.\n",
      "[20] Le Tribunal rappelle que la disponibilité est une condition préalable à l’admissibilité aux prestations. La demande de prestations indique que lorsqu’on demande des prestations, il faut être capable de travailler et disponible à cette fin, et incapable d’obtenir un emploi convenable. Il faut chercher activement un emploi convenable, accepter des offres pour un emploi convenable et conserver un dossier de ses recherches d’emploi pendant six ansNote de bas page 4.
